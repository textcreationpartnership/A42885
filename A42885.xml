            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>A</hi> DEDICATORY PRAYER <hi>TO OUR LORD</hi> JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MY Lord and my God,</hi> permit me alſo to conſecrate this Second Inſtruction to thee, and lay it at the foot of thy Croſs, to which I invite thy Children, and beg the favour of thy Benediction. That which thou haſt been pleaſed to beſtow upon the Firſt I made, gives me hopes that thou haſt yet reſerv'd a bleſſing for this Second; and that in reſpect of the things therein contained, which are the Sacraments, thy own work, thou wilt not fail to bleſs it. Its whole deſign is to inſtruct thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; to teach them to frequent and make good uſe of the Sacraments: Sacraments, which with ſo much Charity thou haſt inſtituted, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mighteſt conferr thy Grace upon us. We ſee to our great grief, that they have not that eſteem, which is due to them; and that for want of the knowledge of their worth and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and the advantage which from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes to us, many either neglect to approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, or at leaſt do not always take care to provide themſelves with convenient diſpoſitions
<pb facs="tcp:38446:5"/>when they come. Thou preſenteſt them with holy Penance, that thereby they may be freed from the Slavery of their Sins; but it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that like the <hi>Iſraelites in the Aegyptian</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, they chooſe rather to continue captives as before, then to accept thy offer. Thou beſtoweſt upon them Celeſtial food for their nouriſhment, and to ſtrengthen them, whom once thou haſt received into thy Grace; but by reaſon they are ignorant of the excellence of the gift, they either refuſe or neglect to take it, and permit themſelves Spiritually to be ſtarv'd in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart of this Mortal Life. This Bread of Angels agrees not with their taſt, ſo deprav'd it is, that they preferr the Onions of <hi>Aegypt</hi> before this Heavenly <hi>Manna.</hi> Divine <hi>Jeſus,</hi> open their eyes, who live thus contented in their miſery. Make them feel the weight of their Chains; make them ſenſible of the danger of that Servitude, wherein they are detained by Sin; make them aſhamed ſo to affront thee, and debaſe themſelves, as to ſerve the Devil, that Enemy of thy Glory, and their own Salvation. Grant them Grace to aſpire to that liberty, which thy Children, the Children of God, enjoy: that to this end they may embrace Holy Penance, and thereby be entirely converted to thee; and that their actions may teſtify the ſincerity of their hearts. That they may encreaſe and be ſtrengthen'd in thy Grace by means of this Celeſtial Bread; and that by frequently feeding upon thy pretious Body and Blood, they may happily paſs through the dangers of this Life to the Land of Promiſe, which is thy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, where thou liveſt and Reigneſt Eternally.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Here preſent you, <hi>Dear Reader,</hi> with this Second Inſtruction, for the uſe of young People, and alſo of all ſuch as are pleaſed to make uſe of it, that they may learn how they may rightly employ theſe two grand means, Penance and the Holy Euchariſt, inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for our Salvation. I have diſcourſed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of theſe two Sacraments in the Second Part of the Firſt Inſtruction: But I did it with that brevity, which is neceſſary to be obſerved in matters, which one treats of only in paſſant, or by the by, as acceſſories to the main point he deſigns to handle. Since that time I have often obſerved, that what I had ſaid of them was not enough to give young People a full view or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect underſtanding of theſe two Sacraments, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the uſe thereof. Therefore it ſeemed to me very convenient, that they ſhould have a Book, wherein they might be ſolidly inſtructed in what concerns theſe two important Subjects, and benefit themſelves thereby upon either of theſe two occaſions; <hi>viz. 1.</hi> When they find themſelves moved to return to God by a ſincere Repentance, and to conſecrate themſelves wholly to his Service by a true change of their former courſe of life, and to this effect have need to make a general <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of their life paſt, as we have ſaid in the Second Part, the Sixth Chapter of the firſt Inſtruction,
<pb facs="tcp:38446:6"/>
               <hi>2.</hi> When after this general Confeſſion, they are willing to continue in the frequent <hi>uſe of theſe two Sacraments;</hi> that they may do it, as far as it may be needfull to conſerve them in the grace of God, and to advance in Virtue. And this was the motive I had to undertake this Inſtruction, wherein I ſupply what was defective in the former, aend perform the two things, I have but even now ſpoken of. For in the four firſt parts of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction concerning Penance</hi> I ſhew them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means, whereby they may return to God: The firſt of which is an <hi>exhortation to change our life</hi> and totally to addict our ſelves to Virtue. In the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond I ſhew them the way to compaſs this deſign, by treating at large of <hi>Contrition;</hi> of the enormity of Sin, and the practice of this great Virtue. In the Third and Fourth I treat of <hi>Sacramental Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and whatſoever elſe is neceſſary for the worthy receiving of that <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Afterwards in the Fifth Part I ſpeak of the <hi>means to conſerve</hi> the <hi>Grace,</hi> which one hath received by the Sacrament; and to perſever in a truly holy, and Chriſtian life. And the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> which follows <hi>concerning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> may alſo ſerve for the ſame end. For it is moſt certain, that this Divine <hi>Sacrament</hi> is one of the chiefeſt means, which God hath beſtowed upon us to conſerve us in his Grace. Hence it is eaſy to perceive that this Inſtruction is not ſo much a Second Book, as a continuation or concluſion of the firſt I made. I have taken an occaſion to intermix ſome neceſſary points, which one is obliged to know; as the explication of the Principal <hi>Myſteries of</hi> our <hi>Faith,</hi> which I have plac'd in the firſt Part of the Inſtruction concerning Communion; and that of the three Theological Virtues, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which you will find in the Second Part of the ſame Inſtruction: Virtues
<pb facs="tcp:38446:6"/>which are the ground-work of our Salvation, and upon which, as St. <hi>Auguſtin de Verb. Apoſt.</hi> hath it, <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> which is raiſed up by his Grace, <hi>is built.</hi> I have alſo taken occaſion to explain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God in the examen of Sins, which I have plac'd at the end of the Inſtruction concerning Penance: And this I have done, that one might have in this one Book the explication of the Principal points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine which every one is obliged to know, and that one may be inform'd of theſe important truths, which often through his negligence he is ignorant of, either becauſe he conceives them not ſo neceſſary, or that he thinks he knows them ſufficiently well already; which happens but too often, not only to young People, but to many others.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, <hi>Dear Reader,</hi> what I have to tell you upon the Subject of this Inſtruction: After which I have no more to do, but to exhort you to benefit your ſelf thereby. You will not fail herein, if you read it with this deſign, and with a deſire ot improve your ſelf. And as I have compoſed it with no other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion except that of aſſiſting you in your approach to God, and conſerving you in his grace; I hope that if you alſo reade it with this intent, God will bleſs both yours and my deſign. This is what I demand with all my heart, beſeeching him with all poſſible hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility that he will enlighten your Soul rightly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truths, which he hath compriſed in theſe great Sacraments, and that you may draw in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from theſe two Fountains of our Salvation the Celeſtial Waters of Divine Grace; which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you in this life from the mortal heats of Sin, and rendering you fertil in Virtue and good works make you deſerving of Everlaſting Life, the fruit of pious endeavours, and our laſt end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Containing an Exhortation to a true Converſion and Amendment of Life.</head>
               <p>ALL that we have ſpoken in the firſt part of the Inſtruction of Youth, is a continual exhortation to young people to live virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly during the time of their youth; and correct their lives by Penance, if they ſhall be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy engaged in Sin, as it happens but too frequently. This is the cauſe, why it is not at all neceſſary to ſtop here, to exhort them to think ſeriouſly of their Converſion, and Salvation: and that it will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſend them back to the reading of that firſt part.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> why, if you be touched with a deſire to conſider ſeriouſly of the Salvation of your Soul, I beſeech and conjure you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38446:14"/>to read that part of your inſtruction, and to weigh attentively the reaſons, and motives, which I have brought to perſwade, and convince you of the great obligation you have to apply your ſelf to virtue in your tender years: I am confident that if you poiſe them well, and with that ſerious attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter doth deſerve, you will be convinc'd, and conclude with your ſelf thus; It is true, I ought to think of my Salvation, from the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I deſire to return to God, to change my life, and labour earneſtly for my converſion.</p>
               <p>And to the end you may be more firmly fixed in this reſolution, and may perform it with more conſtancy, and without any wavering, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe here an exhortation, which God himſelf hath made you, that ſo I may the better remove from you all reſiſtance, and delay in a buſineſs ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and neceſſary for your good, to which you are exhorted by the voice of God himſelf.</p>

                  <p>IT is in the firſt Chapter of the book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> which was dictated by the Holy Ghoſt chiefly for the inſtruction of young perſons, where the divine wiſdom ſpeaks in this manner.

                     <hi>O Children, how long will you love infancy, and fools covet thoſe things that are hurtfull, and unwiſe hate knowledge? Turn at my correction, behold I will utter my mind to you, and make you underſtand my words. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I called, and you refuſed; I have ſtretch'd out mine hand, and there was none that regarded. But you have deſpiſed all my Councells, and neglected my reprehenſions. I will alſo Laugh at your deſtruction, and mock, when that ſhall come to you, which you fear'd; when ſudden Calamity ſhall fall on you, and deſtruction, as a Tempeſt, ſhall be at hand, when tribulation and diſtreſs ſhall come upon you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſhall they call upon me, and I will not hear, they ſhall ſeek me early, and ſhall not find me: becauſe they have hated knowledge, and not received the fear of our Lord, nor conſented to my counſell, but deſpiſed all my correction. Therefore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own ways, and be filled with their own devices. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of little ones ſhall kill them, and the Proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them. But he, who ſhall hear me, ſhall reſt without terrour, and ſhall enjoy abundance, fear of evills being taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto are the words of God, which call men to their Converſion, and which preſs men to think on their Salvation. But I beſeech you <hi>Theotime,</hi> be not ſatisfied with once reading them, offer not ſuch an affront to the Speech, which God himſelf has made you, as to paſs it over ſo ſlightly; but read it often, till you have perfectly underſtood it, and deeply printed it in your mind, and heart. Deſiſt not from reading, untill you are reſolved to obey, and perform what it requires; and to the end it may make a greater impreſſion, and produce more plentifull fruit in your mind, read alſo theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing reflections.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Reflections upon the Precedent Exhortation, and Firſt upon the things, which it contains.</head>
                  <p>IF you conſider well this divine exhortation, you ſhall find, that it contains five parts.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt, Almighty God, that he might make you reflect upon your ſelf, gives you an amorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of your blindneſs, which moves you to run after your own deſtruction, and ſhews you, that you act not like a man, but like a child, one unwiſe and in a frenzy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. He exhorts you with a fatherly, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodneſs to depart from your blindneſs, and return to him by a true converſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. Becauſe you have heretofore ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his divine admonitions, and interiour motions of his grace, he threatens you with his anger, and ſevereſt indignation, if you continue to deſpiſe his bounty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. He foretells the ſad misfortunes, which ſhall befall you in puniſhment of your obdurateneſs: The only reading whereof is ſufficient to make you tremble, and quake, with horror, and apprehenſion. <hi>In fine,</hi> He oppoſes to theſe misfortunes the favours, and bleſſings, which he heaps upon thoſe, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his voice, and follow his admonitions, &amp; live according to his holy will.</p>
                  <p>Weigh well, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> all theſe things one after another, they are of great importance to you, if you regard them as in themſelves; but more, if you conſider them as they are propos'd by All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and in his own proper words.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Second Reflection upon the Goodneſs of God in Exhorting us himſelf to our Converſion.</head>
                  <p>COnſider firſt, and weigh attentively, that God who invites you to return unto him by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a holy life, is he himſelf, whom you have moſt greivouſly offended, by neglecting his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, looſing his grace, &amp; incurring his indignation. To God you are become an Enemy by your Sin, and he might juſtly deſtroy you for evermore. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he is the firſt that invites you to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd unto him, and urges you to return into his favour. He himſelf ſeeks after you, he prevents and exhorts you to reconcile your ſelf unto him; and this moves you not at all!</p>
                  <p>Seek amongſt men an example like this, of one, who being offended, goes to meet his Enemy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites him to a reconciliation, and you ſhall not find any: And this example of God himſelf, who does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater things for your ſake, does not move you, ſo as to make you return unto him. Is this poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? can there be an obdurateneſs like this?</p>
                  <p>But conſider in the ſecond place, the quality and greatneſs of the Perſon, who Exhorts you to return unto him, and enter again into his favour; which is no leſs then that of God himſelf. God who is infinite in Greatneſs, Power, and Majeſty, before whom all the Grandeurs of the World are but duſt and aſhes: who makes the powers of Heaven and Pillars of the Firmament to tremble. This God, ſo great, ſo powerfull, doth humble himſelf ſo far, as to go and meet a wretched creature, an ungratefull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38446:16"/>man; who hath forgotten the favours of his Creator, deſpiſed his commands, and loſt his friendſhip: this God ſeeks for ſuch a man even in the bottom of the abiſs, the ſtate of mortal Sin, wherein he is, to exhort him to come forth, and offers him his hand to withdraw him from that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: yet this inſenſible creature hearkens not at all, chooſing rather to continue in his miſery, then give ear to the voice of God, that would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. This is you your ſelf, <hi>Theotime,</hi> who treat in this manner almighty God, when you refuſe to obey his voice, who calls you to your Converſion. If a King ſhould ſhew ſuch bounty towards a criminal, and that miſerable creature ſhould refuſe the favour of his Prince, would it not be, a thing without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and would not men ſay, that he had loſt both his ſenſe and reaſon? what ought you not to ſay, and judge of your ſelf, who perform the ſame in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if God did receive any benefit by your Converſion, this might ſomething (tho' but little) diminiſh the eſteem, which we ought to have for that exceſſive bounty, which he manifeſts by ſeeking us firſt. But the truth is, he can receive no advantage, for all that he ſeeks is your good, and not his own: He will not be more happy, when you ſhall be ſav'd; nor leſs bleſſed; if you ſhall be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for he is glorify'd as well by the actions of his juſtice, as by thoſe of his mercy, <hi>Quid prodeſt Deo ſi juſtus fueris aut quid ei confers ſi immaculata fuerit via tua? what profit,</hi> ſaith Job, <hi>doth God receive from thy juſtice, or what advantage doth thy holy life yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him?</hi> Job 22. All the advantage is to your ſelf, and not to him; it is your happineſs, and not his. It is true, he takes a great pleaſure in ſhewing his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38446:17"/>and exerciſing his bounty towards thoſe, who make not themſelves unworthy of his favours: but then it is alſo moſt certain, that he is glorify'd by the puniſhment of the wicked. This is that which he himſelf hath declared by his Prophet <hi>Moyſes,</hi> to his people of <hi>Iſrael. As our Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rejoyced upon you, doing good to you, and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, ſo he ſhall rejoyce, deſtroying and ſubverting you.</hi> Deut. 28.63.</p>
                  <p>Is it not then a ſtrange blindneſs to reſiſt the voice of God, who ſeeks after us out of his pure bounty, and for our only good? What can we ſay of our ſelves, <hi>Theotime,</hi> if we are ſo obdurate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible in the concern of our Salvation? Doubtleſs there is great reaſon to cry out with St. <hi>Hierome, O clementia Dei! O noſtra duritia! dum poſt tanta ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera nos hortatur ad poenitentiam, &amp; nec ſic quidem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus ad meliora converti. O the meekneſs of God! and the hardneſs of humane heart! ſince after ſo many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his mercy exhorts us to repentance, and yet our heart is ſo obdurate, that it refuſes to ſubmit to the word of God, and be converted.</hi>

                  <p>AS the Bounty of God towards Sinners ſeems not to be able to advance farther then to court and ſeek after their friendſhip; ſo the wickedneſs of man cannot reach to an higher pitch, or do a greater injury to God, then by deſpiſing and neglecting the wonderfull goodneſs he manifeſts in this occaſion.</p>

                  <p>That we may rightly apprehend the greatneſs of this injury we ſhall make a ſmall reflection upon the actions of God towards man, and upon the actions of man towards God.</p>
                  <p>The Divine Bounty performs that to man, which man denies to his fellow-Servant. It may ſometimes happen, that the offender begs pardon of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſubmiſſively requeſt a reconciliation, and a reſtitution to his favour; but upon what extrinſick Motives, proceeds this chance-acknowledgment of a fault, will eaſily appear; as either he is an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and may juſtly expect the ill conſequences of prejudiced Power; or that an after thought fears a revenge from the provoked; or that Intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, he ſeeks how advantageous his friendſhip may be for the future; or ſome like reaſon brings him to this act of a ſpecious humility: But that a perſon, by his Inferior, nay and even his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, moſt heinouſly offended againſt the ſtricteſt tyes of humanity and gratitude, and from whom he can neither expect a favour, nor fear an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; as for example a Maſter, Superior, King or Benefactor; That this Perſon ſeek his friendſhip, by whom he had been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offended; This is that, which one man never performs to another: Yet this is that which God performs towards man, <hi>viz.</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter towards his Servant, a King towards his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a Judge towards his Criminal; and, that I may comprize all in one word, God toward his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and Ungratefull Creature. And in this he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts unto the world a goodneſs and love which only appertains unto himſelf. <hi>In hoc eſt charitas quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam ipſe prior dilexit nos.</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.

Was there ever any Bounty like unto this? See here how God behaves himſelf towards man in this occaſion. Let us now ſee how man comports himſelf towards God.</p>
                  <p>You underſtand, <hi>Theotime,</hi> very well, what his duty is; it is, without doubt, to yield himſelf conquer'd by this admirable Love; and to caſt himſelf into the arms of this infinite goodneſs, which invites him ſo amorouſly to receive him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his favour: But ſtand aſtoniſhed at both his and your own actions after ſo long entreaty.</p>
                  <p>This God, whom you have grievouſly offended, ſeeks after you firſt, and exhorts you to return unto him, offering you pardon for your Sins. This God ſo great and ſo powerfull, who hath no need of you in any thing, invites you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats you to return unto his favour. He who can raiſe as much Glory to himſelf from your Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in puniſhing you by his juſtice, as he ſhall receive from your Salvation, by making you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his mercy. Yet nevertheleſs out of the ſole deſire, which he hath of your happineſs, he abaſeth himſelf even to invite, and urge you to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and you will not hearken to him at all; you refuſe, or defer to follow the invitation of his love, and perform what he requires of you for your own good. Can there be an affront like unto this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> in his miſeries complained that even his Servants themſelves did not regard him, and that they inſolently ſcoft at the requeſts which he made them. <hi>Servum meum vocavi &amp; non reſpondit mihi: ore proprio deprecavi illum. Job.</hi> 10. Judge
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38446:18"/>then how God may blame you, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints he will make of you, when you continue in your wicked life, and defer to obey his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions: will not he have reaſon to make the ſame complaint as he did in times paſt of the <hi>Jews? I have ſtretched forth my hands,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>towards that incredulous, and always rebellious people, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts my words.</hi> Iſai. 65. <hi>Tota die expandi manus meas ad populum incredulum.</hi> That which a Maſter will not do in reſpect of his Servant, which is a man like himſelf, God performs in regard of you, and you take no notice of it: but to ſpeak plainer, God performs that for your ſake, which a Servant would ſcarce do for his Maſter; he ſeeks you, as if he had need of you; he ſollicites you, as if he had a want of you. O divine Love, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thee, I cannot but exclaim according to the expreſſion of an Author of theſe latter days.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>O amor, O pietas nostris bene provida rebus!</l>
                     <l>O bonitas ſervi facta miniſtra tui! <hi>Picus Mirand.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>O Love, O piety of God, who haſt ſo great a care of our Salvation! O goodneſs how great art thou, that makeſt thy ſelf a Servant of thy Servants!</p>
                  <p>But converting our conſideration to our own obdurateneſs and ingratitude, and to the contempt we have of thee, I deplore our miſery with the words of the ſame Author.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>O amor, O pietas noſtris male cognita ſeclis!</l>
                     <l>O bonitas noſtris nunc prope victa malis.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>O Divine Love, O goodneſs, how little art thou reflected upon in our age! O bounty, it is true that thou art infinite, yet our Sins are become ſo great, that we have much reaſon to fear leſt they ſhould furmount thy goodneſs, and oblige thee to withdraw thy Mercy from us.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Fourth Reflection upon Gods anger, againſt thoſe, who refuſe to yield to theſe Exhortations.</head>
                  <p>THe injury of this refuſal being ſuch as I have ſaid, or rather above all that we can think or imagine, it is certain that it highly moves Gods anger againſt thoſe, who render themſelves guilty: <hi>Quanta eſt haec injuria &amp; quam graviter pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienda: cum viliſſimus vermis clamantem ad ſe audire dedignatur creatorem?</hi> St. Bern. Sec. 23. <hi>de diverſis. How great is this injury</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Bernard</hi>) <hi>and what Chaſtizements ought it not to expect: when wretched man, who is leſs than a little worm of the Earth, is ſo impudent, as to refuſe to hearken to the voice of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> who ſpeaks to him for his Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Without doubt this refuſal doth greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the anger of Almighty God, as it is a contempt of his divine words and admonitions: of all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, contempt is the moſt inſupportable; and of all contempts there is none greater, then that by which one refuſes a reconciliation with their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; principally when he offers himſelf, and expreſſes his deſire: what will then the contempt be, which one ſhews on this occaſion towards Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God himſelf?</p>
                  <p>He that would Seriouſly conſider of it, would ſoon perceive how injurious and affrontive it is to Almighty God, and how much it provokes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God againſt thoſe who render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty: but that I may make you more clearly diſcern it, I ſhall give you here the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God himſelf upon this ſubject, which he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38446:19"/>hath declared in many places of the Scripture; reade and conſider well that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>In the 65. Chapter of <hi>Iſaias</hi> God numbers up all the iniquities of his People, and after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached their enormous ingratitude, he ſaith, he will deſtroy them for all their crimes, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, becauſe they had contemned thoſe mild ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, which he had ſo often made them for their converſion and Salvation. <q>
                        <hi>And you who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Lord, who have forgotten my holy Mount, I will number you in the Sword, and you ſhall all fall by Slaughter, becauſe I have called, and you have not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I ſpake, and you have not heard, and you did evil in mine eyes, and you have choſen the things that I would not,</hi> Iſa. 65.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the following Chapter he repeats the ſame menaces, where he ſaith, that as the wicked take a delight in the things that diſpleaſe him, ſo he will take a pleaſure in bringing upon them all the evils that they feared; and then adds the reaſon, <q>
                        <hi>I have called and there was none that would anſwer, I have ſpoken and they heard not.</hi> Iſai. 66.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſpeaks more effectually in the 7th Chapter of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy.</hi> 
                     <q>And now becauſe you have done all theſe works, and I have ſpoken to you early riſing, and ſpeaking you have not heard: and I have called, and you have not anſwered: I will do to this houſe, wherein my name is invocated, and wherein you have confidence, and to the place, which I have given to you, and your Fathers, as I did to Silo: <hi>and I will caſt you away from my face, as I have caſt away all your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the whole ſeed of Ephraim.</hi> Jer. 7.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to ſhew how great his Indignation was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that people for contemning his ſayings, and the exhortations which he had ſo often made them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38446:20"/>for their Converſion, he forbids his Prophet to pray for them, and to oppoſe himſelf by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Deſign he had to puniſh them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf of them. <hi>Tu ergo noli Orare pro popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo hoc: nec aſſumas pro eis laudem &amp; Orationem, neque obſiſtas mihi: quia non exaudiam te. Thou therefore pray not for this People, neither take unto thee Praiſe and prayer for them, and reſiſt me not, becauſe I will not hear thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Could God give a greater mark of his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them who refuſe to be converted, then is expreſs'd in thoſe Words, ſince he refuſes that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould appeaſe him by their prayers, by which they would endeavour to hinder the execution of his juſtice?</p>
                  <p>But if his anger were ſo high, againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> for this reaſon, how can we expect it ſhould be leſs againſt Chriſtians, &amp; againſt us our ſelves, <hi>Theotime,</hi> who contemn no leſs his divine grace, and who continue in our diſordered lives, and in our Sins after ſo many exhortations, and admonitions to leave them? This is the reflection which St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> made upon this place, which we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and keep well in minde. <q>
                        <hi>Viz. that all that which God there ſpoke to the People of the Jews, ought to be underſtood of us, if we commit the ſame faults that the Jews did: Quidquid illi populo dicitur, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus &amp; de nobis ſi ſimilia fecerimus.</hi> St. Hier. in c. 7.

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Great Puniſhment which God lays upon thoſe, who refuſe or defer their Converſion.</head>
                  <p>ALL the Paſſages which I have brought, do ſufficiently ſhew, the heavy Chaſtiſement which God ſends to thoſe, that contemn him in that manner: The Scripture contains a vaſt number of others. But we need not ſeek farther, then in this Exhortation of God, which we have ſpoken of above. Learn from God himſelf, what you ought to fear, and the misfortunes that will befall you, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt any longer the deſire he hath of your Salvation.</p>
                  <p>The puniſhments are contained in theſe words. <hi>Ego vero in interitu tuo ridebo, &amp; ſubſannabo vos. I will laugh at your Deſtruction, and mock at you:</hi> words full of terrour, which ought to make all thoſe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who are in mortal Sin. <hi>Dicat nunc qualiter fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riat, quos ad ſe nullatenus revertentes tanta longanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſuſtentat. St. Greg. lib</hi> 18. <hi>moralium c.</hi> 7. It is for thoſe, according to the advice of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> to <hi>learn hence</hi> from the mouth of God himſelf, <hi>in what manner he will puniſh thoſe, whoſe converſion he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a long time, without any effect on their part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe words God threatens to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of thoſe at the hour of their death, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their ſins; to puniſh their wicked life with an unfortunate end, and treat them at that laſt hour, as they have dealt with him during their life. Is not this moſt juſt and reaſonable? They abandon'd God during their Life, and God abandons them at the hour of their death. They refuſe to hearken, when he ſpeaks, and moves them to their Salvation;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38446:21"/>they contemn his admonitions, and will give ear to nothing, but their own Paſſions, and follow no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their pleaſures: They perform all their actions, as if they Mocked God; and God by a juſt but dreadfull puniſhment will act in reſpect of them as a provok'd Enemy, who Scoff's at his Conquer'd Foes, and Inſults over their utmoſt miſeries, with which he ſees them overwhelmed.</p>
                  <p>He will behold them Surprized with ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full accident, or a mortal Agony which in a ſmall time will carry them away: He will ſee them Searching all means to Eſcape, Overwhelmed with griefs; troubled with fear and trembling; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Remorſe of their guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; calling to him for their Succour and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; but he will not hearken at all: He will become Deaf to their Prayers as they would not give ear to his admonitions: He will not hearken to their deſires for their deliverance, as they would not hearken to his advices for their Salvation: He will not give them time for repentance, being they refuſed it when it was in their power, and when they were exhorted by God himſelf. Thus will they dye Miſerably, ſeeing themſelves conſtrained to abandon a mortal Life, with all the Pleaſures which they lov'd more then either God, or their Salvation, to go and begin an Eternal Death; where for fleeting Pleaſures they ſhall find immortal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and an infinity of evils, which ſhall never end.</p>
                  <p>It is thus, <hi>Theotime,</hi> that God ſhall treat thoſe who contemn his Favours, and refuſe to hearken to his Voice, when he invites them to their Salvation; and thus will he puniſh them always; and that you may better comprehend this Chaſtizement of God, take notice of three great evils which compoſe it.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:38446:21"/>
                  <p>The Firſt is an unprovided death, which he will ſend to thoſe, that are impenitent, when they ſhall leaſt expect it. <hi>Cum irruerit repentina calamitas, &amp; interitus quaſi tempeſtas, ingruerit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is an oppreſſion of grief, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes in that dreadfull ſurpriſe, pains of Body and Senſes, anguiſhes of Soul and Conſcience: this is that, which is ſignified by thoſe words of God, <hi>Cum irruerit ſuper vos tribulatio &amp; anguſtia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third, which is the moſt dreadfull, is God's forſaking them in that laſt and deplorable extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; a forſaking ſo great, that he will never more hearken to their prayers and crys, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith in the following words, <hi>tunc invocabunt me &amp; non exaudiam, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And all theſe miſeries will befall them in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their obſtinacy in their Sins, and refuſal to be converted. <hi>Eo quod exoſam habuerint diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, &amp; ſermonem Domini non receperint, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would to God, <hi>Theotime,</hi> this chaſtiſement were as rare, as it is frightfull and terrible. But it happens too often by a deplorable misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and is but a juſt effect of the divine juſtice, which frequently puts in Execution his threats againſt thoſe, who ſo often contemn his holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations.</p>
                  <p>All the Chriſtians, who are either dead, or dayly dye in Mortal Sin, (of whom the multitude is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable) are witneſſes of this truth; All thoſe to wit, who are ſurprized by unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, either of ſickneſs, wherein they dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Confeſſion; or Confeſs, but in haſte, without neceſſary diſpoſitions: or having time to Confeſs, defer it to the laſt extremity of their ſickneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more taken up with the grief and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38446:22"/>of death, then moved with the thought of their Salvation and Converſion: Or elſe alſo thoſe, who confeſs themſelves in due time, yet have no true ſorrow for their ſins; but are ſorry rather by reaſon of the Evils, that ſurround them, then upon any motive of the Fear, or Love of God; theſe alſo, altho' they have all the exteriour marks of true Penitents, as having duly performed all the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour acts of Penance; (which makes us believe that they are truly Converted, and departed in the grace of God) Yet, in effect, they ſhall be damned for ever.</p>
                  <p>In fine, <hi>Theotime,</hi> it cannot be denied, but that there are a great number of Chriſtians Damned: It is alſo moſt certain, that this doth not happen, but becauſe they have not done true Penance for their Sins before their death: and why have they not done it? Except it were that death ſuprized them in the ſtate of ſin; and did not give them time, or means to do Penance, or at leaſt perform it, as they ought. But how happened it, that they were ſo ſurprized? unleſs it were, that, by the juſt judgment of God, thoſe menaces were executed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, wherewith he ſo often threatned to puniſh their hard and obdurate hearts: by ſupri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, when they thought the leaſt of it, and abandoning them at the hour of their death.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Theotime,</hi> they muſt be extremely deaf, and in a deep Lethargy, who are not awakened with theſe Thunder-claps: and they muſt be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible not to fear the dreadfull effects of theſe menaces of Almighty God; which happen dayly to many of the World. Be afraid then, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the ſeverity of all misfortunes, that may attend you. That which happens unto many, may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38446:22"/>perhaps happen unto you; and if it ſhould befall you, in what condition would you remain for all Eternity?</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Concluſion of this Exhortation.</head>
                  <p>AS this great Exhortation comes from God himſelf; it is proper alſo, that he himſelf ſhould give us the Concluſion, and that we ſhould learn from him, what we ought to conclude, and perform, after we have heard his voice, that calls us to our Salvation. We ſhall learn it from the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 3. Chapter, where he exhorts the Chriſtians, not to be rebellious to the voice of God, and not to imitate the obdurateneſs and rebellion of the Jews, which God puniſhed ſo rigorouſly: Hearken then to his words, and his concluſion: <q>
                        <hi>Wherefore</hi> (as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith) <hi>to day if you ſhall hear my Voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of the temptation in the Wilderneſs, where your fathers tempted me.</hi> Heb. 3.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He purſues and urges ſtrongly this advice, as well in this Chapter, as in the following; where he ſhews, that the Jews were not rejected of God, but for their incredulity, and reſiſtance, that they made to his words. <q>
                        <hi>To whom did he ſwear, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, but unto them that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed not? ſo that we ſee, that they could not enter in becauſe of unbelief.</hi> Heb. 3.18.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He adds afterwards, how the Chriſtians ought to fear the like Chaſtiſement: <hi>Let us therefore fear,</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:38446:23"/>(ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>leſt at any time by forſaking the promiſe of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to be deprived</hi>—<q>
                        <hi>Let us therefore ſtudy to enter into that reſt, leſt any man fall after the ſame example of incredulity.</hi> Heb. 4.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And about the End of this Epiſtle, in the 12 Chapter, he renews again this ſo important an Advertiſement, by theſe words, which ought to be engraven in all the hearts of Chriſtians. <q>
                        <hi>See that you deſpiſe not him that ſpeaketh to you; for if they eſcaped not, who refuſed him, that spake on Earth; much more ſhall we not eſcape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven.</hi> Heb. 12.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>See, <hi>Theotime,</hi> the Advertiſements, which the Apoſtle gives to all thoſe, whom God has fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd ſo as to ſpeak to them for their Salvation, and call them by his voice to their Converſion. Conſider them attentively, with the reaſons he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, and think well upon it, what you are to do. Aſſure your ſelf, that it is to you that God addreſſes himſelf, when you have underſtood the above-mention'd preſſing Exhortation, which he hath made for your Converſion. Be afear'd to fall into the dreadfull chaſtiſements with which God hath puniſhed the obſtinacy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and uſe all your endeavours to avoid them; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any other means eſcape them, then by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly complying with the deſire which God hath of your Salvation, and making now a firm reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to return unto him by Penance, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect change of your former life, for effecting whereof I propoſe the following means.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38446:24"/>believe this of you; wherefore, methinks, I hear you demand of me, what muſt I do, that I may obey the Voice of God, and become a good and real Convert, and a true Penitent?</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer with the chief of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, do Penance for your Sins, and receive the Sacrament, not of Baptiſm, ſince you have once received it, and it cannot without Sacrilege be repeated; but of Penance, to obtain hereby the remiſſion of your Sins, and the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, which will aſſiſt you to lead a new Life. Let us betake our ſelves to Holy Penance, which is a Second Baptiſm, a Baptiſm of tears and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to cleanſe therewith all our Sins. <hi>Baptiſemus lachrimis conſcientiam, qui peccatis inquinavimus Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</hi> St. Ambr. <hi>Let us waſh our Conſciences with tears, who have defiled our Lives mith a great number of offences.</hi> Let us weep before God our Creator, and caſt our ſelves into the arms of our Coeleſtial father, whilſt yet he hath them open to receive us, and ſo lovingly calls us to him. Let us not delay, leſt he may ſhut them in puniſhment of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity: Let us prevent his anger by having recourſe unto his Mercy: and let us perform that, which the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts us to do, in Concluſion of the above-mention'd admonition. <hi>Let us therefore,</hi> ſaith that Divine Apoſtle, <hi>go boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may receive Mercy, and find Grace to help in the time of need.</hi> Heb. 4.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> What Penance is.</head>
                  <p>SInce we cannot return to God after Sin by any other way, but that of Penance; it imports us very much to know, what it is; and to underſtand well this means, which is of ſuch importance, as that without it we can never be ſaved, according to that weighty ſentnece of our Saviour. <hi>If you do not do Penance, you will all periſh. Niſi paenitentiam habueritis, omnes ſimul peribitis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Penance ſo neceſſary may be conſidered two ways. As it is a Virtue, and as it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for it includes both theſe excellent qualities.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is one of the Chriſtian Virtues, which hath for its object, and end, the deſtruction of Sin in him, that hath committed it, and the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the divine juſtice by ſorrow and good works.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is alſo one of the Seaven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the New Law, being raiſed to that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when he gave to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and their Succeſſors power to remit Sins.</p>
                  <p>As a Virtue, Divines define it thus. A Virtue or gift of God which makes us deplore and hate the ſins, which we have committed, with a purpoſe to amend, and not offend any more for the future.</p>
                  <p>Its principal acts are <hi>Confeſſion, Contrition,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> that is a declaration or acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they have ſinned before God, by which they owe themſelves before him guilty, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of puniſhment: it being certain that the firſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38446:25"/>degree neceſſary to obtain pardon for a fault, is to acknowledge it, and declare our ſelves culpable. It was for this reaſon that <hi>David</hi> ſaid, that he had confeſſed his ſins before God, and had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained pardon. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contrition,</hi> that is to ſay, a regret or ſorrow for having offended God; becauſe the declaration of the crime is not ſufficient to obtain pardon; except we alſo teſtify and declare a regret and diſpleaſure from our heart; without which it is impoſſible to obtain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> is a puniſhment which one lays on himſelf, to repair the injury he hath done to God by Sin, that he may more eaſily obtain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and bear the puniſhment which his juſtice ſhould impoſe: It being certain, that it is in the liberty of him, that pardons an injury, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it on what condition he pleaſes, and reſerve what puniſhment he ſhall think convenient for it. Hence it is that St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. ſaid, that he, who does Penance, ought to offer himſelf to endure, and be chaſtiſed by God in this life that he may avoid eternal puniſhment; and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> begged of God with ſo much earneſtneſs, that he would be pleaſed to chaſtiſe him in this world, ſo that he would pardon him in the next. <hi>Hic ure, hic ſeca, modo in aeternum parcas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As theſe three acts compoſe the Virtue of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they alſo make the parts of the Sacrament, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath inſtituted upon this ſame Virtue. The words of this inſtitution are theſe, which he ſpoke to his Apoſtles on the day of his Reſurrection. <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins you remit are remitted, and whoſe ſins you retain are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. John.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:38446:25"/>
                  <p>By theſe words he hath given to the Apoſtles and their Succeſſours the Power to remit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Sins of the faithfull; and by a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence he obliged the faithfull, that ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin, to put themſelves in a ſtate fit to receive that remiſſion, and to have the diſpoſitions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which a Sin cannot be pardon'd, neither by God nor men, which are <hi>Confeſſion, Contrition,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction: Confeſſion,</hi> by which the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents declare their Sins to him, who hath Power to judge, to wit, the Prieſt; becauſe a judge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give Sentence of a Crime, if he know it not, or it be not brought before him to judge; <hi>Contrition,</hi> becauſe a Sin cannot be remitted to him, who doth not declare ſome ſorrow before the Judge: and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> becauſe to receive a remiſſion, one muſt be diſpoſed to receive it upon the Conditions, that ſhall pleaſe him who gives it, and with that reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Chaſtizement that he ſhall think proper to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as is already ſaid. So theſe three acts, ſerving as diſpoſitions for the remiſſion of Sin, ſerve alſo for the matter of the judgment, which the Preiſt makes, of the ſame Sin, and of abſolution, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces in virtue of the power, which Jeſus Chriſt hath given him.</p>
                  <p>And theſe two things joyn'd together, to wit the acts of the Penitent, and the abſolution of the Prieſt, compoſe the Sacrament, which we call Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; whereof theſe acts are the matter, and the Abſolution is the form; which are two parts neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Behold <hi>Theotime,</hi> what Penance is, and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that you ſhould conſerve in your mind this Idea, and the diſtinction, which we now made, as the ground-work of all that, which we ſhall ſay on this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38446:26"/>Subject: Becauſe to make a true converſion, of which we ſpeak here, Penance is requiſite in both thoſe two manners, both as a Virtue, and as a Sacrament. The Sacrament is neceſſary, becauſe it is by its vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that one receives the remiſſion of Sin: and the acts of this ſame virtue are likewiſe neceſſary, both before and after the Sacrament: Before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to diſpoſe one to receive it; and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd it, to Satisfy God, and conſerve ones ſelf in Grace, as we have ſaid above.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> What Contrition is.</head>
                  <p>I Begin to explain the acts, or parts of Penance with <hi>Contrition;</hi> becauſe it is the moſt neceſſary of all; for without it, the others are of no value, and it may ſupply the want of the other in caſe of neceſſity, on condition that it include the will to confeſs, and ſatisfy when we are able. Wherefore read attentively, what follows.</p>
                  <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> gives us a perfect Idea of this great action, when it defines it in theſe terms, to be <hi>A grief of mind and a deteſtation of Sin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, accompanied with a reſolution not to commit it any more. Counc. Tre. Seſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>It ſays, that it is <hi>a grief of mind,</hi> that is, a regret and interiour diſpleaſure, which is conceiv'd in the heart for having offended God. And <hi>a deteſtation</hi> by which word is meant a Hatred and an Averſion, which one hath to Sin, in looking on it, as a wicked thing and mortal Enemy to our Salvation, and the Glory of God. <hi>With a reſolution not to Sin any more.</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:38446:26"/>This is a neceſſary conſequence of the grief and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Sin. For he who hath a regret for an evil, and truly deteſts it, he alſo hath a will to avoid it; if he hath not this will, it is certain, he hath neither ſorrow, nor averſion.</p>
                  <p>By this definition you ſee, that <hi>Contrition</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of three interior acts, a Sorrow, a Deteſtation, and a good Purpoſe. Deteſtation is the firſt Act, which is the ground-work, on which are raiſed the other two. For he who hath conceiv'd in his heart an hatred againſt Sin, hath a Sorow for having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, and a purpoſe not to commit it any more. So that we muſt chiefly apply our ſelves to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation or hatred; and this is what we muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take notice off.</p>
                  <p>That we may arrive at this, we muſt perfectly underſtand the malice, that is included in Sin.: for we only hate and deteſt thoſe things, which we know to be wicked.</p>
                  <p>Now there are in Sin two ſorts of evils, the evil of the <hi>fault,</hi> and the evil of the <hi>puniſhment.</hi> The firſt is the <hi>Injury,</hi> which by Sin is done to God. The other is the <hi>damage,</hi> which the ſame Sin draws up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Us in puniſhment of that injury, which we did to God. The one regards God, the other our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and both of them render Sin infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable. The evil of the <hi>fault,</hi> becauſe it offends God, and the evil of the <hi>Pain,</hi> becauſe it makes us looſe God, and become puniſhable by eternall Damnation.</p>
                  <p>In fine, <hi>Theotime,</hi> there is nothing more deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which ought to breed in us a greater hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, then the cauſe which produceth theſe two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which are the greateſt and moſt terrible of all miſchiefs. Sin offends God ſo highly, and is ſuch
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38446:27"/>an injury done unto him, that all men and all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells together are not able to comprehend, how hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous it is, ſo grievous is it. Is there any evil more heinous &amp; deteſtable? The ſame Sin, by this injury, which it does to God, ſeparates us from him, makes us looſe his Grace, excludes us for ever from his Glory, and makes us ſubject to eternal Damnation: And can we ſpeak, or think, of an evil more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and which deſerves more our hatred and deteſtation.</p>
                  <p>Let us raiſe our thoughts higher, and conſider Sin not only in general, and as it is others; but as it is within our ſelves; and ſay to our own hearts; By the Sins which I have committed, I have offended my Creator, my Redeemer, my Benefactour, my All, God infinite in greatneſs, in Bounty, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs; without cauſe, without reaſon; by my malice alone, and blindneſs: Good God! how happens it, that I have not a horrour of my ſelf and of the evils, which I have done.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame Sins I have loſt the Grace of God, I am become his Enemy, I am deprived of Heaven, I am fall'n into the Slavery of the Devil, and made a Victim of Hell. O Sin, how horrid art thou! O ſiin, why have I committed thee! O Sin, I hate and deteſt thee with all my heart, and above any thing that is deteſtable in the world. <hi>Iniquitatem odio habui: &amp; abominatus ſum.</hi> Pſalm. 118.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the qualities, or conditions, which true Contrition ought to have.</head>
                  <p>WE ſpeak not here of perfect <hi>Contrition,</hi> (whereof we ſhall treat in the following Chapter) but more generally of the Conditions, which grief, neceſſary for the obtaining the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin, ought to have, whether it be perfect or imperfect; and I ſay this <hi>Contrition</hi> muſt have four Conditions, to wit, it muſt be <hi>Interiour, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> and <hi>Sovereign:</hi> Take notice of theſe Conditions, for they are of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and many are deceived in them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Contrition,</hi> or ſorrow for Sin ought to be <hi>Interiour,</hi> that is to ſay, from the Heart; and when it is only in words and outward appearance, it is not <hi>Contrition,</hi> but an Illuſion: The Heart muſt ſincerely produce the Sentiment and Sorrow, which the words expreſs: For this reaſon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſaid above, that it was <hi>a Sorrow of Mind,</hi> and a deteſtation of Sin: Now this deteſtation is an Act of the Will. The Scripture ſaith, that it is a Converſion, that is, a return of the Heart to God: <hi>Convert your ſelves to God with all your hearts.</hi> We muſt ſeek for God by Penance, and in ſeeking we ſhall find, <hi>if we ſeek for him with all our hearts, and with the ſorrow and tribulation of our Souls.</hi> Deut. 4. God reprehended the Penance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who made great Exterior Demonſtrations, even to tear their Cloaths, as a mark of their ſorrow, but they were not touched in their Hearts. <hi>Convert your ſelves to me</hi> (ſaith God to them) <hi>with all your hearts,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38446:28"/>in Faſting, in Tears, and Lamentations, and tear your Hearts, and not your Garments.</hi> Joel. 2.</p>
                  <p>In fine, <hi>Theotime,</hi> there is nothing more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt both by Scripture and Reaſon, then this truth, that Penance oght to be in the Heart, that is in the Will: that as the Will was the cauſe of Sin, ſo alſo it may be the cauſe of Sorrow, and produce Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The Heart muſt revoke the evil, which it hath wilfully committed, and deteſt Sin, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it had affected.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is not ſufficient to deteſt Sin in the Heart; it muſt alſo be deteſted upon a good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that is upon a Motive ſufficient to obtain Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the Sin. This Motive, that it may produce that effect, muſt be <hi>Supernatural,</hi> that is one of thoſe which God hath revealed, and which we know by Faith: The reaſon is, becauſe an Action purely Natural cannot procure ſanctification for the Soul, which is wrought by Grace, and is a thing above Nature. Hence we aſſigned the Second Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Contrition</hi> to be Supernatural, that is conceived upon a Supernatural Motive, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by a Motion inſpired by God.</p>
                  <p>This Supernatural Motive hath relation to two Heads: <hi>Viz.</hi> to that which concerns our Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural good, which is Eternal Happineſs; and to that which regards the Glory of God. I ſay our Supernatural good, becauſe the Natural goods, as Life, Health, Honour, Riches, are not able to raiſe ſuch a ſorrow for Sin, as might ſerve to obtain the Pardon from God. This we muſt take good notice of: Such was the ſorrow of <hi>Saul,</hi> who did not grieve for his Sin; but for the loſs of his Kingdom, which he ſaw God would deprive him of. Such was the ſorrow of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who did not weep for his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38446:28"/>Crimes; but becauſe of the great Misfortunes he found himſelf overwhelmed with. Such many times is the grief of Chriſtians, who demand pardon for their Sins, when they are ſurrounded with Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they reſent more livelily, then the evils, which they have committed by their Sins, which move them little, or nothing. It is very true, that Afflictions make us return to God, and he himſelf ſends them us for that effect: but there is a great deal of difference between the occaſion, which makes us do an action, and the motive for which it is performed. Afflictions ſerve for an occaſion to return to God, becauſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake us from the ſleep of ſin, make us reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, be ſorry for the crimes, that cauſed them, and have recourſe to God for our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: but they ought not to ſerve, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to deteſt our ſins; becauſe that would be only a pure natural ſorrow, which avails nothing to reſtore us unto the grace of God. We muſt have a higher motive, and returning to God by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, deteſt our ſins; by reaſon of the danger, to which they expoſed our Eternal Salvation; or the honour of God, which they have infinitely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Whoſoever hath not theſe motives in view, or one of them, hath not the <hi>Contrition</hi> which diſpoſes to grace.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, we have ſaid, that <hi>Contrition</hi> muſt not be only ſupernatural, but alſo <hi>Sovereign,</hi> that is, moſt powerfull. The meaning hereof, is, that it doth not ſuffice to deteſt ſin upon a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural motive, but that this motive ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule, and keep above the other, which come into our mind: ſo that we ſhould rather deteſt the ſin by reaſon of the damage it brings to our Salvation,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38446:29"/>or the injury done to God, then for any natural evils it may produce; and be reſolved to ſuffer them all, rather then commit one Mortal ſin. This is what Divines call deteſting ſin, <hi>ſupra omne deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> that is, above all that which in the world may ſtir up our hatred and deteſtation.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is moſt clear, becauſe ſin is the Sovereign evil, and the greateſt of all evils. For if we conſider the offence, there is none more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, then that which it commits againſt God; and if we caſt our eye upon the puniſhment, there is none more Dreadfull. This is the reaſon, why one cannot deteſt it ſufficiently, but by deteſting it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all naturall misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>Herein yet we muſt mark well, that this greater deteſtation, doth not conſiſt in being more ſenſible, more lively, or more vehement then the hate and deteſtation of other evils; becauſe that is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, nor always in our power: but this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the eſteem, or judgment, which we make of Sin, accounting it really the greateſt of all evils, as in effect it is; and deteſting it in this quality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, and purpoſing firmly not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it any more, upon any account whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>But we are yet to obſerve, that to have that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of Sin above all evils in our heart, it is not at all neceſſary, that every evil in particular ſhould be propoſed, as Death, Torments, Infamy, and the like; but it ſuffices, that they ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in general. Likewiſe, it is not convenient they ſhould be propos'd ſeverally; leſt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation ſhould make the mind to waver in its Reſolution, or make reſolutions lightly, and with preſumption of its own forces; which would not be perform'd; when occaſions were offered: as it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38446:29"/>happened to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> It is ſufficient to eſteem Sin the greateſt of all evils, which can ever befall us; To hate and deteſt it as ſuch, to make a new reſolution not to commit it any more, but rather to undergo whatever misfortune may happen to us, truſting in the mercy of God, and hoping he will either free us from thoſe miſchiefs, or that he will give us ſtrength to ſupport them by his Grace, then offend him.</p>
                  <p>The 4th condition of <hi>Contrition</hi> is, that it muſt be Univerſal in reſpect of all Mortal Sins: that is, by it we muſt deteſt all, without excepting any, and have a reſolution never more to commit any one mortal Sin. The Holy Ghoſt pointed at this Condition, when he ſaid, <hi>that we muſt do Penance for all the Sins we have committed. If the Sinner ſhall do Penance for all his Sins, he ſhall Live. Ezech.</hi> 18. We muſt convert our ſelves to God with all our hearts; that is, the heart muſt totally be offered to God, and not divided, ſo as to give one part to God, and the other to Sin. <hi>Their hearts</hi> (ſays he elſewhere) <hi>are divided, therefore ſhall they dye. Hoſea.</hi> 10. The reaſon is evident, becauſe Mortal Sins cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but altogether, not one without the reſt. Man cannot reſerve in his heart an affection to any one Mortal Sin, but he will of neceſſity incur the hatred and diſpleaſure of God. The <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which one may think he hath of other Sins, if yet he affect any, cannot juſtify him in the ſight of God; for it is abſolutely falſe and imaginary; becauſe if he really hates any, he hates all Sins, there not being any one which doth not cauſe his damnation, and infinitely offend God.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that thoſe deceive themſelves, who pretend to do Penance, and yet refuſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don injuries, or to be reconciled to their Enemies;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38446:30"/>thoſe alſo, who will not reſtore the goods they have unjuſtly gotten, and thoſe who are careleſs in avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the immediate occaſions of Sin, and ſuch other like: In a word, all thoſe, whoſoever they be, that have any willfull tye upon them to any particular Sin, which yet they are not fully reſolved to break aſunder, are imaginary, but not true Penitents.</p>

                  <p>But when above this motive we raiſe our thoughts higher, and hate Sin by reaſon it is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the ſupreme goodneſs of God, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be beloved above all things, which we ought to affect more then our ſelves, and which we are obliged to love, altho' there were neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, nor Hell; it is an act of perfect <hi>Contrition,</hi> which proceeds from <hi>Charity,</hi> and the pure <hi>love of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Contrition</hi> is good, and profitable; it is ſupernatural by reaſon of its motive, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an effect of the inſpiration of the Holy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38446:30"/>Ghoſt; but it doth not reſtore man unto Grace, except it be aſſiſted by the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> becauſe it is not of it ſelf, without the aſſiſtance of the Sacrament, an act of Charity, which can juſtify, but only an act of the Virtue of Hope, which is not able to confer Grace.</p>
                  <p>The Second is excellent and perfect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores the Soul to the grace of God, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the receiving of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> but not without reſpect to the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> becauſe it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a will, or diſpoſition of mind, to receive it, when occaſion ſerves.</p>
                  <p>In either of them both, there is a <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God, but differently. For in <hi>Attrition</hi> there is a ſervile fear, and an imperfect love, which makes us only regard our own advantage. In <hi>Contrition</hi> there is a filial fear, and a perfect love or Charity; which makes us conſider the honour of God, more then our own concern.</p>
                  <p>By the one and the other we hate ſin: but by the firſt we hate principally the puniſhment of ſin, and we fear that more, then the fault, or offence of God. By the Second we deteſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the offence of God, and we fear that more, then the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt take notice of a point of great concern: when we ſay, that in <hi>Attrition</hi> we fear <hi>more</hi> the pain, then the offence; this <hi>more,</hi> or this exceſs, is not to be underſtood of a Poſitive preference, or eſteem, which one may have, whilſt he compares the puniſhment with the offence. For he, who comparing theſe two together, ſhould ſay, either expreſsly, or tacitly, that he fears <hi>more</hi> to be damn'd, then to offend God, would commit a Mortal Sin; but this is to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38446:31"/>be underſtood only of, as we may call it, a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, or abſtractive preference; which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, when one thinks of the puniſhment of ſin without reflecting on the offence of God, which becauſe it occurrs not to his mind, he doth not think of; but ſtops as it were only at the puniſhment which occurrs, as being more ſenſible, and without advancing farther, conceives a horror of ſin, and deteſts it upon that account, without riſing higher, or thinking of the offence.</p>
                  <p>But if it chance that any one think expreſly both of the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of ſin, and the <hi>injury,</hi> which thereby is done to God, comparing the one with the other; ſuch a perſon would be obliged to deteſt them both, according to their merits, that is, the offence more then the puniſhment. I ſay more, not as to the greatneſs, or vehemency of the fear and deteſtation, but as to the preference and eſteem, which the will makes of the one above the other, that is, of the offence above the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>In the practice, <hi>Theotime,</hi> conſider, that it is fitting, we always endeavour to have them both; for to content our ſelves only with the imperfect <hi>Contrition</hi> is the part of a mean ſpirit, and a token of a ſervile and mercenary ſoul; beſides, that this manner of treatment is apt to raiſe doubts of Conſcience, and troubles of mind: on the other ſide, an act of perfect <hi>Contrition</hi> is an act of the higheſt perfection, and to perform it is a very difficult thing; it is not uſual, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we, ordinarily ſpeaking, aſcend at one ſtep to the higheſt and moſt perfect acts of a Virtue: wherefore we muſt begin with thoſe of the lower rank, and by them mount up to thoſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38446:31"/>of an higher claſſe; this we ſee, that nature her ſelf teacheth us in all her productions. But which is very obſervable, it frequently happens, that we are deceived in this occaſion; for many are perſuaded that they have perfect <hi>Contrition,</hi> as ſoon as they have pronounc'd theſe words, I deteſt my ſins, becauſe God who is infinitely good, is offended by them. But there is a great difference between ſaying theſe words, and conceiving in our heart the true ſenſe, which they import.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, we muſt begin with imperfect <hi>Contrition;</hi> after that we have conſidered the great and lamentable miſchiefs, which by ſin are heapt upon us; the privation of the grace of God; the loſs of Paradiſe; Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then we muſt proceed to hate and deteſt it with all our heart; as our moſt mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Next conſidering that ſin, muſt needs be a horrible evil in it ſelf, and ſtrangely offenſive to the Divine bounty, ſince he puniſheth it with ſo much rigour, we muſt go on to the hatred of ſin it ſelf, by reaſon of the injury it doth to God. An injury which derives its greatneſs from the Supreme, the infinite Bounty, Sanctity, and infinitely adorable Majeſty of God, whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it infinitely offends, and conſequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes infinitely deteſtable, and which ought to be hated and deteſted with a ſupreme, and, if poſſible, infinite hatred, altho' there were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paradiſe, it could deprive us of; nor Hell to puniſh it.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the means to obtain Contrition.</head>
                  <p>IF it were either the ſame thing to have <hi>Contrition,</hi> and to know it; or the knowledge of it were ſufficient, to have it; there would be nothing more required, then what we have ſaid, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Act. But it is far otherwiſe, <hi>Theotime,</hi> this great and important action is not ſo eaſy, as they imagine, who believe, they have power to produce it every moment. It is a fruit, which is not of our growth; it is a plant, which our Earth, now dry and barren by means of ſin, cannot bring forth, except it be watered from above, and prevented by the bleſſing, or grace of God. <hi>God,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>muſt give his benediction, and then our Earth,</hi> that is our Heart, <hi>will produce its fruit. Dominus dabit benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem, &amp; terra noſtra dabit fructum ſuum.</hi> Pſal. 84.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſo facile to clear ones ſelf of ſin; as it is eaſy to fall into it. A man may quickly caſt himſelf into a deep pit by his own fault; but he cannot get out without trouble, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of another. We ſin by our own free will alone, but by this alone we cannot free our ſelves from the guilt of ſin; it is neceſſary that the grace of God aſſiſt and withdraw us from it. Our ruine proceeds from our ſelves; but our Salvation comes from God; he alone can ſuccour, or redeem us. <hi>Perditio tua ex te, tantummodo in me auxilium tuum. Hoſt.</hi> 13. This is an Article of Faith, which hath always been believed in the Church, and which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:38446:32"/>hath defined of new. <hi>If any one ſays, that without the preventing inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, a man can believe, hope, love, or be ſorry for his ſins, as it is neceſſary to receive juſtifying grace, let him be anathematized.</hi> Conc. Trid. Seſſ. 6. Canon. 3.</p>
                  <p>With what fear and trembling ought not thoſe Souls to be ſeized, whoſe conſcience tells them, that they are in the unfortunate ſtate of Mortal Sin? What horror ought they not to conceive, when they ſeriouſly make this reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that their Salvation depends upon God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and that they cannot of themſelves be freed from the danger they are in, except by his only hand, whom they have ſo grievouſly offended, and who is their profeſſed Enemy, as long as they ſhall continue in that State?</p>
                  <p>But that which yet ought ſtill to augment their fears, is that there is nothing due to them from God, as long as they are, in that deplorable ſtate, his enemies: that he is not obliged to relieve them, having never promiſed it to any perſon: but that he may moſt juſtly leave them in that condition; becauſe as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>God who hath promiſed pardon to him that ſhall do Penance, hath not promiſed Penance to any one.</hi> O God! <hi>Theotime,</hi> what conſiderable reaſons of fear, and trembling are there, to ſee ones ſelf, in ſuch a lamentable ſtate, wherein he may be juſtly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by Almighty God, and left as a prey to the ſworn Enemies of his Salvation? What good things ought he not to do, who conſiders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this danger? or rather, (I will not ſay what Evil, but even) what indifferent things ought he not to deny himſelf? that, by doing good, and avoiding evil, he may both prevent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38446:33"/>the misfortunes, which environ him at preſent; and avoid the eternal loſs of his Soul, which threatens him for the future.</p>
                  <p>Without queſtion you ſee clear enough what he ſhould do; firſt that he ſhould ſeek all means poſſible to appeaſe the divine anger, &amp; regain his favour; which cannot be otherwiſe effected, but by ceaſing to offend him, by performing acts of condign Penance, and by pouring forth his Soul in hearty prayer, that he may obtain from God the grace of Holy <hi>Contrition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Second place, that he ſhould apply himſelf to conſider the ſins he hath committed, meditate upon the motives which are capable to imprint in his Soul an horror of them; then he ſhould propoſe to himſelf the examples of true Penitents; imitate them in their Penances, and conquer Heaven by the force of tears and <hi>Contrition,</hi> as they have done.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall diſcourſe of theſe two general means in the following Chapters.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="chapter">
                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the firſt means to obtain Contrition, which are three, avoiding ſin, works of Penance, and Prayer.</head>
                  <p>I Put theſe three means togeher, becauſe they are ſo inſeparable, that they ſeem to make but one.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is to forſake ſin, or ceaſe from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God; for how can you expect to gain the Spirit of <hi>Contrition,</hi> or the Holy Virtue of Penance, whilſt you perſiſt actually to offend
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38446:33"/>him, and reſiſt his grace? and how can you have in your heart a true ſorrow, and deteſtation of ſin, when you take pleaſure to commit it? This is impoſſible. Sin is the deſtruction of divine grace; it roots out of the Soul all pious thoughts; it baniſheth all holy inſpirations, and diſperſes them at their firſt appearance, like a blaſting North-wind, by its cold and dryneſs; it ſcatters the Clouds, diſperſes the Rain, or dew of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and parches up the Earth. This is what theWiſe man would ſignify by thoſe myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words of the <hi>Proverbs. Ventus Aquilo diſſipat plavias: Auſter congregat diſſipatas. Prov.</hi> 25. It is ſin, which locks up the Heavens, and hinders the rains of Grace from ſhowring upon men, when they need it moſt; whilſt they ſtand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to his wrath. On the contrary, the fear of Gods Judgments, which ſeizeth upon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is like the favourable South-wind, which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Clouds, diſſolves them into Rain, and pours them upon the Earth: this fear is a gentle gale that breaths into the Soul the thoughts of Penance; it moves us to conceive true ſorrow for our ſins, and at laſt brings us to the ſo much to be deſired Port, <hi>perfect Contrition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second means is to abridge ones ſelf of pleaſures, and perform the works of Penance: next to ſin, there is nothing more oppoſite to <hi>Contrition,</hi> (which is the fruit of ſorrow) then pleaſures. <hi>Contrition</hi> is not found but in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and miſeries, of which the heart is incapable in the time of pleaſure. <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeaking of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſays, it is not found in the houſes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights. <hi>Job</hi> 28. <hi>Non invenitur in terra ſuaviter viventium.</hi> Much leſs <hi>Contrition,</hi> which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38446:34"/>is the beginning of Wiſdom. <hi>Contrition</hi> is the off-ſpring of an afflicted heart ruminating on all his ſins in the bitterneſs of his Soul; and can this be found amongſt divertiſements and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? No, no, It is moſt certain, that he who reſolves to be Penitent and contrite, ought to baniſh far from his thoughts divertiſements and pleaſures, and betake himſelf to the works of Penance, as Faſting, Alms-deeds, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The Third neceſſary means is <hi>Prayer,</hi> becauſe <hi>Contrition</hi> being, as is above declared, a gift of God, a gift which is not due unto us, but proceeds from his pure bounty; it is certain, we have great need to demand, pray, or beg it of him very earneſtly; need to acknowledge our own miſery, and the abſolute dependance we have upon his mercy. Upon this occaſion it is, that we ought to re-enter perfectly into our ſelves, and humble our ſelves in the preſence of God, in a profound acknowledgment of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, to which we are reduced by this ſtate of ſin. It is upon this occaſion we ought to employ thoſe excellent Sentences of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy; Ego vir videns paupertatem meam in virgâ indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis ejus.</hi> It is true, O my God! I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the extreme miſery, whither thy anger hath juſtly reduced me. I am now in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, inſtead of the light of thy grace, which I formerly enjoyed. Thou haſt turned thy hand againſt me; thou haſt taken away all my forces, and environ'd me with bitterneſs and pain; my Life is fall'n into an abiſs, out of which I cannot get out. Conſidering my ſelf in this ſtate, I ſaid, I was loſt: but I had recourſe unto thee, O my God, I invoked thy Holy
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38446:34"/>Name from the depth of my miſery. Thou haſt graciouſly hearkned unto me, do not turn away thine Ears from the lamentations which flow from my heart, from the clamours, which I make, to obtain thy mercy.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Motives of Contrition, and firſt of the grievouſneſs of ſin.</head>
                  <p>WHen you demand of God, <hi>Contrition</hi> by Prayer, and works of Penance, you muſt not be wanting to your ſelf, but endeavour on your part to procure it. This endeavour conſiſts in weighing attentively the motives, which are capable to raiſe this ſorrow in your heart, and in meditating upon the grievouſneſs of ſin, and the reaſons which may move you to an horror and deteſtation of it. This practice is abſolutely neceſſary for him, who deſires to be truly converted; But is not much in uſe; as God himſelf complains by his Prophet. <hi>There is none,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that repents himſelf of his ſins, ſaying, what have I done?</hi> Jer. 8.</p>
                  <p>Do it then, as you ought, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> and with all the attention of your heart, whilſt you read what I ſhall here propoſe unto you; and beg of God, that he will make you comprehend, and underſtand this ſo important a concern; for it is impoſſible without grace to know it exactly right.</p>
                  <p>You muſt then ſuppoſe, that the grievouſneſs of ſin is ſo great, that it is incomprehenſible, or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38446:35"/>unconceivable; and this truth alone, may make you judge of the greatneſs of it. To compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this grievouſneſs, you ſhould have a full Idea, or true definition of ſin, which might perfectly explain it's nature; But this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. The ſovereign good, which is God, cannot be defined, becauſe it is infinite; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo can ſin, which is the ſupreme evil. That is infinite in goodneſs; this is infinite in malice: That poſſeſſes all perfections; this is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of all miſchiefs. And as no created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit can comprehend the Greatneſs, Bounty, and Perfections of God; ſo none, but God, can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the grievouſneſs, malice, &amp; miſeries of Sin.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is very evident, becauſe to underſtand well the grievouſneſs of ſin, and the injury it does to God, we muſt know how great, how holy, how good, how perfect God is; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſin takes it's grievouſneſs from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it hath with the Greatneſs, Bounty, and Holineſs of God. To know the greatneſs of an offence, we muſt know, and well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, the greatneſs and dignity of the perſon offended. For this reaſon to compehend the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs, and the injury it does to God; we muſt meaſure the greatneſs of God; but where is the meaſure of this accompliſhment of goodneſs and perfections, ſo much raiſed above us? certainly we can never find it, nor by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the meaſure of that Abyſs of malice and miſery, of which we ſpeak here. <hi>Altitudinem Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li &amp; profundum abyſſi quis dimenſus eſt? who can ever meaſure,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, the height of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the depth of the Sea?</hi> Eccleſ. 1. Much leſs can the greatneſs of God and the grievouſneſs of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38446:35"/>ſin be meaſured. If God be ſo high in dignity &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that no created Spirit can reach him, it is true to ſay, that ſin is ſo profound in malice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, that it is impoſſible to comprehend it.</p>
                  <p>Yet nevertheleſs we muſt not deſpair to have an act of <hi>Contrition;</hi> altho' we cannot conceive the grievouſneſs of ſin. For in that alone, which we ſaid, that we cannot comprehend its grievouſneſs, there is all the imaginable reaſon intirely to abhor and hate it; and lament, when we are ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as to fall into it. Sin then is ſo great an evil, that no created Spirit can conceive its enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; that to underſtand it, we muſt know God clearly face to face, which only God himſelf can fully comprehend. What horror? what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation ought not we to have for ſo great and horrible an evil? and what ſorrow ought we to have, to ſee our ſelves, by our own ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious will, become guilty of it?</p>
                  <p>Ponder this well, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and do not paſs over lightly this conſideration; for it is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. I ſay again once more, there is nothing that can make us hate ſin, more then to know that we cannot comprehend it's grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs; and it is eaſy to ſhew it by a contrary reaſon, but very evident: <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is more capable to raiſe in us a love and reſpect towards God, then when we are fully perſuaded, that he is ſo great, ſo perfect, and ſo amiable, that his greatneſs and perfections do infinitely ſurpaſs all that, which we can conceive of him. Let us apply the ſame to the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, and the evils, which it includes in it ſelf; and we ſhall find, how deteſtable it is. O ſin! is it true then that thou art ſo great, that I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38446:36"/>cannot at all comprehend the heinouſneſs of the injury thou doſt to God? and not only I but all the men and Angels together. Now if thy enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity be ſo prodigious, how can I but hate thee? is not this ſufficient to move a horour of thee? O monſter of wickedneſs! he muſt needs be blind that flys not from thee; O abiſs of misfortunes! how ought I to fear, leſt I ſhould fall into ſuch deep precipices.</p>

                     <label>What is Sin?</label> It is a horrible ingratitude committed againſt God, and a forgetfullneſs of all his favours. Who is it that ſays this?

                     <label>What is Sin?</label> It is an injury done to God in his own perſon, and before his own face; knowing well that he beholds us; and without reſpect to his greatneſs, and Sanctity. <hi>What is it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that my beloved hath done in my houſe much wickedneſs? Jer.</hi> 11.15. and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>For</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>is gone to ruine and</hi> Juda <hi>is fall'n: becauſe their tongue and their inventions were againſt our Lord, to provoke the Eyes of his Majeſty.</hi> Iſai. 3.8.</p>

                     <label>What is Sin?</label> It is a revolting from God, and a renouncing of his friendſhip, and grace, to follow ones own will, paſſion, pleaſure, intereſt, and the like. For this reaſon Divines, after a ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the nature of ſin, have thought, that they could explicate it no better, then by ſaying it was a turning away from God, and a turning to, or embracing the creature. <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio a Deo, &amp; converſio ad creaturam.</hi> Behold, what is done by ſin. Hearken to the judgment and complaint of God himſelf. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>O Heavens upon this, and O Gates thereof be ye deſolate exceedingly; for two Evils have my people done; Me they have forſaken, the fountain of living water, and have digged to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Ciſterns that are not able to hold water. Jer.</hi> 2. The meaning is, that he who ſins, ſeeks his good and happineſs in the creatures, where he ſhall never find it. What greater blindneſs then this? See what they do, who offend God mortally; and it is in this preference or eſteem, which we make of the creature before God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38446:37"/>himſelf, wherein Mortal Sin and its greivouſneſs doth conſiſt. For as the love of God above all things conſiſts in preferring him before all, that is before ones proper will, paſſions, pleaſures, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, intereſt: So Mortal Sin, which is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to Charity, conſiſts in preferring all things, or any thing before God, and chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loſe the Friendſhip of God, then deprive ones ſelf of thoſe apparent goods, which in reality are true Miſeries. And he who reſolves to commit a Mortal Sin, performs this in effect: as if he ſhould place on one ſide the greatneſs of God, all his favours, all his promiſes, and all his menaces; and on the other ſide his own Paſſion, his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, his Honour, or his Riches: and having compared theſe two, ſo oppoſite objects together, ſays within himſelf; I make more account of theſe miſerable things, then of the greatneſs of God, of his friendſhip, of his promiſes, and of his threats: and I renounce all that, ſo I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my Paſſions, my Pleaſure, my Ambition, my Avarice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Conſider this well, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and you may Comprehend ſomething of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs of Sin, and the evil you have done to your ſelf, when you have been ſo blind, as to fall into it.</p>

                  <p>ALL that which we have ſaid, is more then enough to give a judgment of the heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mortal Sin; but becauſe the more we ſink
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38446:38"/>into the matter, the more copious is the Subject; behold yet one more conſideration to diſcover its enormity.</p>
                  <p>Sin is a reſiſtance to the Divine will, or as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath very well defin'd, it is a Swerving from the Law of God, and a diſobedience to his Divine Commandements. <hi>Proevaricatio divinae le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, &amp; coeleſtium inobedientia mandatorum.</hi> This diſobedience offends God, and injures him ſo, as to violate the right, which God hath to be obey'd, and loved by his Creatures. It's alſo neceſſarily accompanied with all thoſe indignities, which we have ſaid above are found in Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> Rebellion againſt God, Ingratitude, Contempt of him, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence committed in his Adorable Preſence, and Eſteem and preference of the Creature before God, a Renouncing of his Friendſhip, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Indignities: And this it is, which makes the injury done to God by this Diſobedience, moſt Heinous, and far ſurpaſs all that one can imagine.</p>
                  <p>And being that this vile and baſe injury is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to a Perſon the moſt Eminent and of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Dignity, whoſe Authority is Boundleſs, and infinitely raiſed above all that is great. Hence it is, that this affront is ſo immence, that it infinitly ſurpaſſes all the abuſes, and wrongs, that can be offered unto man: it being a certain Rule, that an offence takes its heinouſneſs from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Perſon that is offended: And thus an affront offered to a Prince, doth far Surmount that done to one of baſe condition. Now being that God is infinite in Greatneſs and Majeſty, it follows that an injury offered to him is alſo infinite.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:38446:38"/>
                  <p>Add all theſe things together, an Infinite of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed againſt the Infinite Greatneſs of God, accompanied with all thoſe Indignities we have ſpoken of, with Rebellion, with Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, with Contempt of God, with Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a creature before his Friendſhip, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity: and judge what we ought to ſay of the greatneſs of the Injury, which Sin offers to God. But above all conſider the Sin, as committed by a Wretched creature, by a Miſerable ſervant, by a worm of the Earth, which before God is leſs then nothing; Judge then I ſay, if you can, but you can never arrive at a perfect Judgment, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the knowledge of both Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were united in your underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>An affront ſo great, that it made St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and other Divines after him to ſay, that it were far better the whole frame of the world ſhould periſh, that is Heaven, and Earth, and all contain'd therein, then that a man ſhould commit any one mortal ſin againſt God. <hi>Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt inhonorare Deum, quod non debet facere homo, etiamſi totum pereat quod non eſt Deus. Sin,</hi> ſaith that Holy Doctor, <hi>is to diſhonour God, which a man ought not to do, altho' all things, except God, be deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An injury ſo horrible that it made St. <hi>Anſelm</hi> ſay, That <hi>if he ſhould ſee on one ſide Hell open with all its flames; and on the other ſide, one ſole Mortal Sin to be Committed; and that he were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make choice of the one, he would rather chooſe to caſt himſelf into hell, then ſin mortally. S. Anſelm de ſimilitudinibus. c.</hi> 190. And he adds the reaſon. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I ſhould rather deſire, being innocent and without ſin, to enter into Hell, then enjoy Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38446:39"/>being defiled with ſin; for it is moſt certain, that only the wicked are tormented in Hell, and only the juſt are bleſſed in Heaven.</hi> Altho' this neceſſity of choice can never happen; yet the ſuppoſition, which this great Saint makes, doth manifeſtly ſhew the grievouſneſs of Mortal ſin, &amp; the injury which by it is done to God: and it is grounded upon this manifeſt truth in Divinity; that the evil of the fault is infinitely greater, and more to be feared, then the evil of the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>A wrong ſo heinous, that Divines with one accord agree, that if all the men in the world, and all the Angels in Heaven, ſhould unite their forces, to deplore the injury offered to God by any one mortal ſin, to do Penance, and give Satisfaction to God for it; they could not all together in the leaſt perform that which it deſerves.</p>
                  <p>A damage ſo great, an abuſe ſo deteſtable, that only God himſelf was able to repair it, only God himſelf could ſatisfy for it to the full; and to perform this, it was neceſſary, that God ſhould put himſelf in a ſtate to ſatisfy, that he ſhould humble himſelf ſo as to become man, to offer himſelf in Sacrifice to the Divine juſtice: a Sacrifice, which equalled the price, and alſo far ſurpaſs'd the grievouſneſs of Sin; and in which two things were admirably conjoyned, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and Humanity, this to be offer'd, and that to give infinite value and merit to the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as a Father of the Church ſaid excellently well. <hi>De noſtro obtulit Sacrificium, de ſuo contulit pretium. Euſeb. Emiſ. hom.</hi> 6. <hi>de Paſcha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, an injury ſo offenſive and enormous, that the Flames of Hell, which it hath kindled,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38446:39"/>can neither purge it for all Eternity; nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Divine wrath, which it hath incens'd, againſt thoſe, who neglective, whilſt they lived, to apply to themſelves the Satisfaction made by the Sacrifice offered by the Son of God upon the Croſs, are dead in Mortal Sin.</p>

                  <p>SInce it is moſt certain, that the beſt way to know a cauſe, is to conſider its effects; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the beſt means to diſcover the grievouſneſs of Mortal Sin, is to reflect on the Sad effects which followed from it.</p>
                  <p>We have ſaid before, that we could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly know Sin in it ſelf, becauſe it is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme evil, which is infinite: no more then we can underſtand in it ſelf the Supreme and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign good, which is God. But as by the effects, which we ſee of his Power, of his Wiſdom, of his Goodneſs, we arrive at ſome knowledge of God: So on the Contrary, we may find out in ſome ſort the heinouſneſs of Sin, if we do but conſider attentively the Dreadful effects, it cauſes, and the horrible misfortunes which it carries with it. And all theſe effects are, as ſo many Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull motives of <hi>Contrition,</hi> to make us deteſt, and abhor Sin.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:38446:40"/>
                  <p>To diſcover it the better, we ſhall obſerve ſome order, and ſearch for it in ſeveral places, <hi>viz.</hi> in our ſelves, in Heaven, in Hell, in God himſelf, and in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="article">
                     <head>
                        <hi>ARTICLE. I.</hi> Of the death of the Soul, or the ſad effects which Sin produceth in his Soul, who commits it.</head>
                     <p>I Begin with the Death of the Soul, becauſe this is the firſt effect, which Sin produceth, as ſoon as ever is is committed. <hi>Peccatum cum conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fuerit generat mortem,</hi> Jac. 1. And I would to God, it were as ſenſible as it is real, and that thoſe, who are ſo unfortunate, as to fall into Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin, might exactly know the greatneſs of the evil, which thereby they draw upon themſelves, as really in it ſelf it is; and reſent it, as it deſerves. It is for this reaſon, that I deſire to explicate it unto you, and make you underſtand it.</p>
                     <p>Sin then, (ſaith the Scripture) is no ſooner fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but immediately it cauſeth Death. It's certain, that it is not the death of the Body; for a man doth not dye in the moment, he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it. It is then the death of the Soul, a thouſand times more dreadfull then that of the Body: for this doth but ſeparate the Soul from the Body: but the Death which is cauſed by Sin, is a Separation of the Soul from God; who is a Supernatural Life, as St. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith. <hi>vita corporis anima eſt, vita animae Deus eſt.</hi> And as this life, which God gives the Soul, is infinitely more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable then that, which the Soul confers upon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38446:40"/>the Body, which it animates: ſo the Death which cauſeth the loſs of that Divine Life, is infinitely more dreadfull and Lamentable, then naturall Death.</p>
                     <p>To underſtand this well, you muſt know what God hath reveal'd, and we believe, concerning a Soul, which hath the Bleſſing to be in the State of the Grace of God: And it is this; when God receives a Soul into his Friendſhip, he Cloathes her with the Robe of Sanctifying Grace, a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and Divine quality, which cleanſeth the Soul from all the ſpots of Sin, and renders her agreeable to the eyes of God. And at the ſame moment he repleniſheth her with Divine gifts, as Faith, Hope, Charity: and other Chriſtian Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: Then by the means of that Grace, God dwells in that Soul after a particular manner, he makes her his Temple and Habitation, where he is pleaſed to be adored, and loved by the Souls, that poſſeſs him: Laſtly, he interchangeably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates himſelf unto her, filling her with his holy Spirit, and Divine Inſpirations.</p>
                     <p>All theſe truths are drawn from the expreſs words of the Sacred Scripture. As from that where God promiſes, <hi>That he will pour upon us a clean water, which will cleanſe us from all our ſtains:</hi> Ezek. 36. This water is Sanctifying Grace. From that where he ſaith, <hi>That the Charity of God is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us,</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>That we are the Temples of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and that the Spirit of God doth dwell in us.</hi> 1. Cor. 3. from thoſe words where our Saviour ſaith; <hi>If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our Dwelling with him. Joh.</hi> 14. From thoſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38446:41"/>words of St. <hi>John. God is Charity, and he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in Charity, remains with God, and God with him.</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. There are a great number of the like paſſages, which clearly repreſent unto us the ſtate of a Soul Sanctifyed by Grace, and the great happineſs ſhe enjoys in that condition, wherein ſhe poſſeſſes God himſelf, and is poſſeſſed by him.</p>
                     <p>Now all this felicity is conſtant and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as to what relates to God, whoſe gifts are without repentance, as the Scripture ſaith: only the Soul can deprive her ſelf of, and deſtroy in her ſelf this happineſs.</p>
                     <p>This misfortune befalls us, when forgetfull of the infinite bleſſing, we poſſeſs, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves to be ſurprized by the allurements of Sin, we break that happy League, and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which God had made with us: And this we do by a criminal diſobedience, whereby we incur the diſpleaſure of God, and loſe in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all thoſe ineſtimable goods, which before we happyly enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>O God, <hi>Theotime,</hi> who can worthily expreſs the dreadfull misfortune, which happens to a Soul by one mortal ſin? and paint to the life the deplorable ſtate, to which it is reduced in the moment ſhe offends? in which the Soul in that very inſtant is deprived of the grace of God, and of one beautifull, and as an Angel in his ſight, becomes as hideous and hatefull as a Devil. <hi>Quomodo obſcuratum eſt aurum, mutatus eſt color optimus. Thren.</hi> 4. Is there any ſubject, where we may more ſitly apply thoſe dolefull words of <hi>Jeremy?</hi> how comes it to paſs, that this Soul ſhould be ſo defaced? what is become of that grace, which made her more bright then gold?
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38446:41"/>how is that divine beauty changed into ſo hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a form?</p>
                     <p>It is an effect of the divine Anger, which hath juſtly fill'd that Soul with cloudy darkneſs; which before had unjuſtly baniſht the light of Grace. But that which is moſt to be lamented is, that that Soul which formerly had the honour to be employ'd, as the Temple of God, now ſees her ſelf rejected by him with horrour and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the Holy Ghoſt retired from her, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving abandoned her to be the dwelling-place of the Devil; according to that ſentence of the ſame Prophet, <hi>repulit Dominus Altare ſuum, male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixit ſanctificationi ſuae. God hath rejected his Altar, and laid a curſe upon the place, where he was adored and ſanctified. Thren.</hi> 2. Is it poſſible, <hi>Theotime,</hi> that you can read theſe words without trembling, if you are in the ſtate of Mortal Sin?</p>
                     <p>It is this forſaking of God, and this loſs of his grace, which properly cauſes the death of the Soul, infinitely more to be feared then that of the Body; foraſmuch as by the death of the body, we are only deprived of the preſence of the Soul, death being only a ſeparation of the Soul from the Body; whereas by the death of the Soul, we are deprived, or ſeparated from Almighty God. Is there any miſery to be compared to this of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of God? O my God! how is it poſſible that men ſhould eſteem thee ſo little? If a man loſe a periſhable good, as a Friend, or an Eſtate, this he laments moſt grievouſly; and we looſe our ſelves, and are not at all concerned: can there be any thing either more unjuſt or more injurious? Is not that moſt exactly true, which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith upon this Subject? <hi>He ſeems
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38446:42"/>not to have the bowels of Chriſtian Charity, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a Body, from which the Soul is departed; and doth not at all weep for a Soul, from which God is ſeparated.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That I may yet make you underſtand more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the deplorable ſtate of a Soul fallen into the diſpleaſure of God; and your own condition, if you are under that misfortune: I ſhall propoſe here an admirable, and moving deſcription, which a Holy Author made in theſe words, which he addreſſes to a Soul fallen into Mortal Sin; and to you your ſelf, if you are in that unhappy ſtate.</p>

This Infernal Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath ſpared nothing; it hath conveyed it's rage even unto the houſe of God, which it hath filled with War, and Confuſion; it hath baniſhed one part of the Angels thence, and ſhut the door to men, and to you your ſelf: let us ſee theſe misfortunes one after another.</p>
                     <p>God in the beginning of the World created an innumerable multitude of Celeſtial Spirits of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Orders, and different perfections; with which he filled Heaven, and compoſed his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Court, for the performance of his will both in Heaven and on Eaath. His deſign was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh them all with the happineſs of his ſight, and the perfect poſſeſſion of the Divinity: And for this effect, beſides the natural perfections he endowed them with, he had created them in his grace, and adorned them with all ſupernatural virtues; thus to afford them a means to diſpoſe themſelves to Glory, which he had prepared for them, and to merit it by their actions, and the practice of thoſe ſame virtues.</p>
                     <p>When they were in this ſtate; behold, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> what Sin did; When they were, as I ſaid, in this ſtate, brim full of mighty hopes; upon the

This was a miſchievous thought of Pride, begun in one of the chiefeſt Angels, who permitting himſelf to be ſurprized by the love of his own perfections, and the brightneſs of his excellent beauty, aſpired to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs all others, in that degree, that he would in ſome things be like unto God himſelf; demanding an Authority equal with his in the government of all Creatures, chooſing rather, as St <hi>Bernard</hi> conſiders, <hi>to be ſeparated from God, then be Subject unto him. Miſer, qui ſine Deo eſſe maluit, quàm ſub Deo. Lucifer</hi> was follow'd in this extravagance by many of the other Angels, who, adhering to his pride, liſted themſelves, as it were, under his banner. They had not perſiſted long in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; when God, who cannot endure the guilt of Sin, be it in whom it will, gives us, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this firſt diſobedience, the manifeſt marks of the hatred he bears to that infernal Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. For by a Solemn Decree, the effect of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, he baniſheth from his Kingdom this Rebellious Angel with all his followers, and caſts them down headlong from the height of Heaven to the moſt profound pit of Hell. Thus that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Spirit, who was, but the inſtant before he ſinn'd, one of the moſt beautifull Creatures of God, and, as one may ſay, the Maſter-piece of all his works; <hi>initium viarum ſuarum,</hi> became by his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38446:44"/>ſin an infernal Dragon; a ſworn and unreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable enemy both to God and Man.</p>
                     <p>What is it that hath cauſed this lamentable change? ſin alone: it was ſin alone that God could not endure in his moſt perfect Creatures. <hi>The Heavens,</hi> as Job ſaith, <hi>are not pure in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and he hath found diſorder even in the Angells. Job.</hi> 15. He found ſin in Heaven, and in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells themſelves; and he hath not pardoned them, as <hi>St. Peter</hi> ſaith, but hath chained them in Hell to be there Tormented, and thereby to manifeſt unto all creatures the hatred he bears to Sin. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>If Sin was ſo dreadfull to the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it hath not been leſs Terrible to men upon earth: if it was able to baniſh them ſo quickly there; it hath not been leſs effectual, or leſs ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Shutting the Gates of Heaven againſt us here. It was, when the firſt man, who being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the grace of God, after he had received all poſſible aſſurance of his Friendſhip both as to this world, and to the next, forgetfull of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and of himſelf, treacherouſly conſpired with his Capital Enemy, and broke the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, in eating the forbidden fruit.</p>
                     <p>He had no ſooner fall'n into this offence; but the Anger God appeared againſt him, and baniſhed him with ſcorn out of the Earthly Paradiſe, that Garden of delight, where but a while before he had been placed with ſo much love; Both he and all his poſterity were condemned to labour, death, and all the miſeries we even now groan under, for that firſt tranſgreſſion of the Law of God.</p>
                     <p>But that, which is yet more terrible, is, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38446:44"/>the Gates of Heaven, which till then were open, were immediately ſhut, as well againſt himſelf, as againſt all his poſterity, without the leaſt hopes of his ever being able to re-enter thoſe happy manſions, by any means he, either of himſelf, or any of his off-ſpring of themſelves, could uſe. O ſin, how dreadfull art thou, and what a train of misfortues doſt thou bring after thee!</p>
                     <p>This miſery and deſolation continued four thouſand years, and more; during which time no man ever entred into heaven, not even the juſt themſelves and thoſe who dyed in the Grace of God, untill the coming of the Son of God into the world, who by his Death opened the Gates of Heaven, ſo long ſhut. During that time, how many millions of ſouls were excluded for ever, and without recovery, from that celeſtiall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This happened to all thoſe, who in that compaſs of time died in their Sins, and without doing penance for them. But after the way was open to heaven by the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, how many are there ſtill, that enter not at all? Hell is filled dayly with millions, and Paradice continues in compariſon like a deſert. Why ſo? It is an effect of ſin alone and impenitence. O, how well did the Wiſe man ſay, <hi>it is ſin which makes men miſerable. Miſeros facit populos peccatum. Prov.</hi> 14. Is it poſſible, <hi>Theotime,</hi> that you ſhould run ſo ſlightly over theſe fatal and horrible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſin, that they ſhould not move you in the leaſt?</p>
                     <p>I might here recount the innumerable miſeries, the continual and dayly effects of Sin: Death which it hath introduced from the beginning; barrenneſs of the Earth; Rebellion of living
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38446:45"/>creatures; the deluge which drowned the world near two thouſand years after the Creation; Plagues and Peſtilence; war and famine; and all the Miſeries, as well publick, as private, which we ſee and dayly feel, are ſo many unfortunate effects of Sin, whether of that of our firſt parent, or of thoſe which men continually commit. For as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Fire, hail, famine, are made to revenge Sin. Eccl.</hi> 39. But I ſhall paſs by all theſe evils, altho' moſt dreadfull and horrible, to come to others infinitely greater and more terrible, whereof thoſe are but the fore runners, according to that infallible Teſtimony of the Son of God. <hi>Haec omnia initia ſunt dolorum,</hi> Mar. 13. <hi>all theſe miſeries,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are but the beginnings of others far greater.</hi>

                        <hi>ARTICLE III.</hi> Of the effects of Sin in Hell.</head>
                     <p>LEt us ſink down into the Pit of Hell, that ſo we may conceive a more lively apprehenſion of the enormity of Mortal Sin: we ſhall there ſee the frightfull evills, which, this Monſter hath produced; and by the vaſtneſs of ſo many dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects, frame a judgment of the malice of that cauſe, which hath brought them forth; and we ſhall there learn two things, the firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Sin, the author of ſo many evils: The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to conceive a wholeſome fear of falling into that abiſs of miſery into which man is thrown by Sin. That which, <hi>St Bernard</hi> ſaid, being moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>It is neceſſary we deſcend into Hell alive,</hi> that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38446:45"/>is, think ſeriouſly and often on it, <hi>That we may eſcape falling into it at the hour of death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſider then, <hi>Theotime,</hi> attentively, what Faith teacheth us concerning Hell; that it is an Eternal fire, which God hath prepared for the Devil and his Apoſtate Angels; and with which he hath alſo decreed to puniſh the Sins of men, who follow the rebellious example of thoſe Ambitious Spirits.</p>
                     <p>This we learn from that terrible Sentence, which the Son of God ſhall pronounce at the day of judgment againſt the wicked. <hi>Go ye accurſed into Everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Mat.</hi> 25. A dreadfull ſentence, which contains no more then four words: but in thoſe four words it comprehends Hell intirely, and all the evils, which compoſe it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt it teacheth us, that the fame puniſhment, which is prepared for the Devils, is alſo appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for men; and that they ſhall be Companions of thoſe wicked and damned Spirits, as they were their followers in their rebellion againſt God: and by this we may ſee what Mortall ſin is, which renders us obnoxious to the ſame puniſhment and damnation with the Devils. Ponder this well, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and behold what it is to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together with the Devils, and as the Devils are damned; and how great that offence muſt neceſſarily be, which deſerves a puniſhment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to that, with which the Devils are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
                     <p>But what will that puniſhment be? I confeſs we are not able to comprehend; but the Son of God by his infinite wiſdom hath ſumm'd it up in four words, that we may more eaſily conceive it. Words which contain all the horror of Hell, <hi>Go</hi>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:38446:46"/>ſays he, <hi>ye accurſed into Everlaſting fire. Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p>By theſe words are denoted the Separation from God, the curſe of God, Fire, and Eternity. Behold in four words what Hell is, behold the puniſhment of Mortal Sin! To be ſeparated from God, to be accurſed of God, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to fire, and that for ever. Who can think of theſe things, and not tremble with fear and horror? Stay ſome time here, <hi>Theotime,</hi> this is not a ſubject to be read in haſt: revive theſe thoughts often, and pauſe a while upon each of theſe frightfull puniſhments.</p>
                     <p>To be ſeparated from God, the Author and Fountain of all good, whoſe only aſpect gives a bleſſing to all Creatures; and who no ſooner turns away his face, but all things are in trouble and confuſion; as the Prophet hath it, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103.</p>
                     <p>To be curſed of God, that is, of Goodneſs it ſelf. To be curſed, that is, hated, rejected with Indignation, abandoned to all poſſible miſchiefs, without relief, without comfort, without hope.</p>
                     <p>To be condemned to Fire, that is, to the moſt horrible of all torments.</p>
                     <p>And this for all Eternity, that is, without hope ever to be delivered from it; ſo that neither a hundred years, nor a hundred thouſand years, nor a hundred thouſand millions of years, make up the leaſt part of that dreadfull duration. The unfortunate Damned ſhall be curſed of God for ever. They ſhall be damned to the Fire of Hell, and that for ever. From that very moment that this final decree ſhall be pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, there will be no further recourſe, or hope of relief. This will be a dreadfull Thunder-bolt, which if once it falls upon their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:38446:46"/>guilty heads, will never be withdrawn. It will inceſſantly torture them, without ever giving them the leaſt repoſe. And during all eternity they ſhall never forget thoſe four words of their Condemnation: <hi>Go ye accurſed into everlaſting Fire.</hi> O mighty God! how terrible art thou in thy Judgments? Is not he ſtrangely blind, and wonderfully inſenſible, who fears not to fall into thy hands at the hour of Death? Who can live without an apprehenſion of that horrible Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thy final Judgment? It is not like the puniſhments and afflictions, which thou ſendeſt to us during this life; and yet how fearfull are we of theſe, which laſt but for a time? whereas that ſhall never end. <hi>Sagittae thae tranſeunt: vox tonitrui tui in rotâ.</hi> Pſal. 76. <hi>Thy Arrows,</hi> ſays the Prophet, that is, the afflictions of this life, <hi>are but paſſing;</hi> at leaſt they end with life: But that terrible Judgment, which thou layeſt upon the wicked, is a <hi>Thunder that ſhall never ceaſe.</hi> From the moment that it ſhall iſſue from thy hands, it continually rowls over their heads, and oppreſſes them without ceaſing, and yet makes them not to dye.</p>

                     <p>THis Subject is too vaſt, and too important, to content our ſelves with the little that we have ſaid: Let us not leave it off ſo ſoon, <hi>Theotime,</hi> let us meditate again and again upon theſe four puniſhments of Mortal Sin, that we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38446:47"/>may comprehend them well, fear them, and conceive a Sacred horror of the cauſe, from whence they come.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, the Damned ſhall be ſeparated from God, ſhall be caſt out of his ſight, never to ſee him more; and to be eternally deprived of the beatifical viſion, and of all the felicities included in it. In a moment they ſhall ſee themſelves fall'n from all thoſe ineſtimable goods, which God hath prepared for his faithfull ſervants; which <hi>neither Eye hath ſeen, nor Ear hath heard, nor ever enter'd into the heart of man.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. Then they will perfectly know, what they have loſt, they will be continually afflicted with rage and deſpair, to ſee that they have loſt ſo rich treaſures, without hopes of ever recovering them again. Then will the Prophecy of <hi>David</hi> be fully accompliſhed, which ſaith, <hi>the ſinner ſhall ſee</hi> the bleſſings and favours, which God hath beſtowed upon the juſt, <hi>and</hi> finding himſelf deprived, <hi>will rage with anger, gnaſh his teeth, and will pine away with grief, and all his deſires will be fruſtrated, Pſal.</hi> 112. and avail him nothing: for it is certain, that God will make the damned know the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which they have loſt; and this knowledge will be one of their greateſt puniſhments, and the cauſe of all the reſt; and that, which will highly increaſe this pain, will be the knowledge of the cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſin, which hath caſt them into this final or never-ending miſery. They will ſee that there was no other curſed cauſe of their utmoſt and irreparable deſolation then that of ſin; and the ſorrow, which they ſhall conceive of this loſs, ſhall be ſo much more encreas'd, as they ſhall more clearly underſtand, that it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:38446:47"/>was by their own fault, that they are deprived of ſo great happineſs; in that they have prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fleeting and deceitfull pleaſures, before real, and eternal bleſſings. From hence it is, that their ſorrow and never-ending lamentations ſpring; from hence their tears and gnaſhing of teeth; whereof the Son of God ſpeaks in the Goſpel: but all to no purpoſe or effect. As long as God ſhall be God, they ſhall continually underſtand that Prophecy, <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is a moſt horrible puniſhment, but this ſhall not be all, for in the Second place, the Damned ſhall be accurſed of God. What is it to be accurſed? Do you underſtand well this word, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to be Curſed? and do you not tremble, when you know it? For to be curſed by God is not only to be out of his favour, to be loathed by him, which yet are dreadfull evils;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38446:48"/>But it is to be deteſted of God in that manner, ſo as to be rejected by him, and abandoned to all poſſible misfortunes. The Curſe of Almighty God is not like that of men; for this is but a deſire, or imprecation of ſome evil, which one man wiſhes to another: and this doth not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take effect, becauſe men deſire evils, which they are not able to inflict. But the curſe of God is efficacious; it cauſeth the evil, which it wiſheth, puts it in execution, without any one being able to hinder, or reſiſt it. <hi>Voluntati enim ejas quis reſiſtit. Rom.</hi> 9. For if there be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, it is that, which increaſeth the curſe, and the evil, which the curſed endure.</p>
                     <p>The oppoſition, which will augment the curſe of the Damned, will conſiſt in this. Their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and rebellious will ſhall eternally reſiſt the will of God: and the will of God ſhall perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually reſiſt, and confound theirs. There never will be any agreement, ſaith St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> between thoſe two wills; becauſe the one is juſt, right, and equitable; the other is unjuſt, perverſe, and wicked, <hi>nunquam recto pravo<expan>

She will be incenſed againſt her own torments, and againſt God himſelf. O what a torture is this, could we but underſtand it rightly? <hi>Quid iniquis voluntatibus tam contrarium, quam ſemper conari, impingere ſemper, &amp; fruſtra.</hi> And is there any torment, (continues the ſame
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38446:48"/>St. <hi>Bernard</hi>) greater then that of the depraved will of the damned? to be always carried on the one ſide with a continual deſire, and to be met on the other with a continual reſiſtance, and all this to no purpoſe, to no effect. <hi>Quid tam paenale, quam ſemper velle, quod nunquam erit, ſemper nolle, quod nunquam non erit? What affliction more painfull then always to deſire that, which will never come to paſs, and continually to wiſh to be freed from that, which they ſhall perpetually eudure. In aeternum non obtinebit quod vult, &amp; quod non vult, nihilominus ſuſtinebit. The Damned ſhall continue during all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without obtaining what he deſires, and yet ſhall everlaſtingly ſuffer the evils, which he would not ſuffer.</hi> Who, ſaith St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> will put all this in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? <hi>Rectus Dominus Deus noſter qui &amp; juſtitias dilexit. St.</hi> Bernard. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de Conſiderat. c.</hi> 12. <hi>It will be God, who is upright and juſt;</hi> and who for that reaſon can never agree with the unjuſt and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved will of the Damned; but on the contrary will perpetually reſiſt it, and eternally confound it. A misfortune, ſaith the ſame Saint, which ſhall certainly befall all thoſe, who ſhall ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt that ſtreight rule, which knows not how to bend, or yield to the contrary, <hi>Vae univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, quod obvium fortaſſe offenderit cedere neſcia rectitudo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such ſhall be the effect of the curſe of God upon the Damned, from the firſt moment that it ſhall fall upon their heads. Doth it not hence appear how dreadfull Damnation is? But this is not all.</p>
                     <p>For in the third place, thoſe wretched and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Souls ſhall be caſt into the torment of fire, even into the fire of Hell. This is the Miniſter and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:38446:49"/>Inſtrument of the Divine Juſtice, the fruit and iſſue of Mortal Sin. <hi>Fire,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>ſhall go before, and conſume his Enemies all about him. Pſal.</hi> 96.3. And in another place, <hi>Our Lord in his anger ſhall ſurround them with trouble, and flames of fire ſhall devour them. Pſal.</hi> 20.10. But what fire, <hi>Theotime?</hi> That <hi>fire which the divine fury,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>hath enkindled againſt the wicked, and will burn even to the bottom of Hell. Deut.</hi> 32.22. That fire, <hi>in compariſon whereof our Elementary fire is but a painted Figure.</hi> As <hi>St. Auguſtin</hi> ſaith; that fire, whoſe ardour is inconceivable, which burn, not only Bodies; but Souls alſo and Spirits by a wonderfull Vertue, which the divine juſtice grants unto it, raiſing it, above the power of Corporal nature, to be able to torment unbodied creatures: That fire, which by another quality, no leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, burns all without either conſuming any other, or ever ſpending its own ſubſtance. Our fire conſumes the things, it burns; and when it hath waſted them, ſpends it ſelf for want of fuel: but the fire of Hell is of a quite contrary nature. It conſerves its proper matter, it burns without either conſuming the matter, or ever diminiſhing it ſelf. For this reaſon our ſaviour calls it, <hi>ignis inextinguibilis, an unextinguiſhable Fire,</hi> and a Father of the Church hath given the reaſon. Becauſe the fire of Hell being created by God for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, it chaſtiſeth the ſin as it is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without conſuming the Author. <hi>Illa enim non caſualis, ſed rationalis exuſtio, quia culpam jubetur inquirere, ſubſtantiam neſcit abſumere.</hi> Euſeb. Emiſ. hom. 1. ad. Manachos.</p>
                     <p>O Fire! is it poſſible that men ſhould fear thee ſo little? is it not a wonderfull thing that ſo many
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38446:49"/>words ſhould be neceſſary to create in men a dread of that infernal fire? whereas we are ſo ſenſible of that, we ſee and feel amongſt us. If a ſmall ſpark fall but on our hands, it makes us cry out amain: if one were conſtrained to put his finger in the fire but for a quarter of an hour, he would not be able to endure it, and yet the fear of the fire of Hell moves us not at all. The Prophet crys out to all the world, <hi>Who of you can dwell with a devouring fire? or who can inhabit everlaſting flames? Iſai.</hi> 33.14. Yet in the mean time, there are but very few that concern themſelves to avoid that horrible torment, or the object that deſerves it, which is ſin: or think ſeriouſly of the means to eſcape it at the hour of death, which are Penance, and a virtuous Life. Ponder this, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and do not follow the throng of thoſe blind people, who run thus headlong to their ruine; and without either foreſight, or prevention, precipitate themſelves into this infernal fire.</p>
                     <p>Now, for the better prevention of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full misfortune, let us conſider its continuance; which will not be for a day, or a year, or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; but for all Eternity. <hi>Inignem Aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> that is, this fire, and all the other torments of the Damned, ſhall never end, they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure as long as God ſhall be God. In this life we have this comfort in our greateſt afflictions, that once they will have an end: Death the moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all evils puts an end to all the reſt: in the worſt of miſeries one wiſhes that Death will come, and it comes at laſt. But in Hell we ſhall not have as much as this Satisfaction; Death there is inexorable: it is always preſent and allways
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38446:50"/>abſent. The Damned ſee it continually, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before their eyes; and yet is always fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them; as it is ſaid in the Apocalips; c. 9.6. Men <hi>ſhall then ſeek Death, and ſhall not find it, they ſhall wiſh to dye, and Death ſhall fly from them.</hi> What more frightfull State then that where one can have no other comfort then that, of Death, and yet Death will never come? there will be no other Life for thoſe miſerable Creatures then a perpetual Death; and no other Death then to live continually amidſt thoſe Tortures: as the learned St. <hi>Paulin</hi> in his Poetry ſaid admirably well.</p>

                     <p>Their Life ſhall be an endleſs Death, and their death ſhall conſiſt in this, to live in Torments, and by means of their never-to-be-conſumed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy continually to maintain their Puniſhment. Their Torments, ſaith another Father, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly deſtroy them; but the juſtice of God will not permit them to dye, and they will continue in that ſtate for all eternity, without ever put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an end to their misfortunes, which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fly from them, and eternally avoid them. <hi>Occidente poenâ, &amp; vivificante ſententiâ, ſtabit ſaeculis materia reparabilis, &amp; nunquam ad metam malorum termino fugiente perveniet.</hi> Euſ.

From hence proceed thoſe horrible Crys and Lamentations, from hence that Rage and everlaſting Deſpair of the Damned, who ſhall clearly ſee, that they ſhall never be freed from their Miſeries. Their minds ſhall always be full of this ſad thought; Thou ſhalt never be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:38446:50"/>freed from hence. What? not after a thouſand years? not after Ten thouſand years? not after a Hundred thouſand years? nothing leſs. Not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Million of years? no, Never. Thou ſhalt be Eternally Tormented. <hi>in ignem aeternum, in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem aeternum, in ignem aeternum.</hi> O Eternity! how Dreadfull art thou? O <hi>Theotime!</hi> is it poſſible you can read this without trembling? as for my part, I declare, I can never think of it without an Horrour. But it is to little purpoſe to have a dread of Hell, if we do not endeavour to avoid it: wherefore let us come to the Concluſion which follows.</p>
                     <div type="conclusion">
                        <head>The Concluſion of this ARTICLE. <hi>Of the pains of Hell.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>IT is of infinite importance, not to read ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in paſſant, theſe frightfull pains, that ſhall never have an end; but into which we may dayly fall. For this reaſon, <hi>Theotime,</hi> I conjure you to read them often with great attention, and add three or four reflections, which here I ſhall ſet before you.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, that all which we have ſaid, or can be ſpoken of theſe Torments, is nothing, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to what they are in themſelves. Humane diſcourſes rather diminiſh then augment them. There can be no exaggeration on this Subject, for the Puniſhment doth far ſurpaſs all our expreſſions.</p>
                        <p>The Second is, that their pains are a juſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Mortal Sin. There is not any other,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:38446:51"/>beſides that curſed cauſe, which hath brought forth theſe ſo dreadfull effects of the Divine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: And which hath ſet God and man at ſuch a Frightfull and final diſtance. <hi>Iniquitates veſtrae diviſerunt inter vos, &amp; Deum veſtrum,</hi> Eſai. 52.2. Theſe ſo Vaſt and Eternal Pains, may make us underſtand three things. The <hi>greatneſs and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> of Mortal Sin; the <hi>Hatred</hi> which <hi>God</hi> bears it, ſince he puniſheth it ſo dreadfully: And the <hi>deteſtation we</hi> ought to have of it, as well for thoſe Pains, as for the hatred God bears to Sin, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this well, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and reflect ſeriouſly upon it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>3d.</hi> is, That you have merited theſe pains of Hell, by the Sins you have committed; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſerved to be of the number of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy damned, of whom we but juſt now ſpoke: To ſuffer the Tortures which they endure: to be from this inſtant out of hopes of ever ſeeing God, or ever being freed from Hell. Is not this conſideration enough to make you weep and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and is not this an urgent motive to raiſe in you a deteſtation of Sin, which hath caſt you into ſuch eminent danger, the only thought whereof ought to make you tremble?</p>
                        <p>But in the fourth place, reflect upon the cauſe, which hath hitherto preſerved you from that dreadfull danger; and you will find no other, then the ſole goodneſs of Almighty God, which hath not treated you according to your deſerts, permitting you to dye in that ſinfull State, as moſt juſtly he might have done; and as he hath done to others that had committed no greater ſins then yours: Where had you now been, had he treated you in that manner? You had been
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38446:51"/>before now eternally loſt, and damned for ever. And why hath he not done it, but only out of that infinite goodneſs he hath ſhewn you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting daily your repentance? O, <hi>Theotime,</hi> how well may you ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Miſericordia Domini quia non ſumus conſumpti: quià non defece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt miſerationes ejus.</hi> Thren. 3.22. Without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it proceeds only from the ſole mercy of God, that you have yet time to work your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. How perfect then ought your love to be towards him, who hath ſhew'd himſelf ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full towards you? and what can you refuſe to do, both for his ſake and your own Salvation, who hath yet granted you time, wherein you may ſecure it.</p>
                        <p>The fifth and laſt Reflection is, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now work your Salvation, nor avoid for the future that Eternal Damnation, except you change your life, and do Penance, to which I exhort you in this Treatiſe: They are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of the Son of God, repeated thrice in the fifteenth Chapter of St. <hi>Luke. Dico vobis, niſi poenitentiam habueritis, omnes ſimul peribitis. I ſay unto you, unleſs you do Penance, you ſhall all periſh.</hi> Take notice, he ſaith <hi>All</hi> without exception, either of old or young, or what condition ſoever. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from hence, and make your reſolution: And remember, that upon this reſolution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends your Salvation and your Eternity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not make a ſlight one, but a conſtant and an effectual reſolution; that is, a purpoſe followed by the effect of a real and ſerious Converſion.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICLE V.</hi> Of the effects which Sin produces in reſpect of God himſelf.</head>
                     <p>THis Title is ſurprizing, and, I declare that if it be taken according to the rigour of the expreſſion, it imports a thing equally incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as impoſſible: For how can God, who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly unchangeable, receive any alteration in himſelf from external cauſes? This cannot be. That Sin ſhould have filled Heaven with diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Earth with miſeries, Hell with confuſion and horrour, is but too true: But that God himſelf ſhould be ſenſible of theſe effects, this is that which cannot be eaſily underſtood.</p>
                     <p>It is true, <hi>Theotime,</hi> that this is hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; but the Sacred Scripture, that Oracle of Truth, repreſents unto us in ſo many places the different effects, which Sin ſeems to cauſe in reſpect of God, that we cannot doubt it. For of all the paſſions, which men conceive againſt evil, or againſt that which is offenſive to them; as Grief, Sadneſs, Repentance, Hatred, Anger, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, Fury: There is none which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not take notice of, as remarkable in God againſt Sin.</p>
                     <p>It ſaith in <hi>Geneſis, c.</hi> 6. that, God ſeeing the Sins of men, was touched with an hearty ſorrow, and repented himſelf that he had Created man, who had abus'd his liberty ſo heinouſly to offend him. <hi>Tactus dolore cordis intrinſecus, dixit, paenitet me foeciſſe hominem.</hi> It ſaith, that thoſe, who Sin,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:38446:52"/>contriſtate the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Nolite contriſtare Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum Sanctum. Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>God hates the wicked and his wickedneſs. Wiſd.</hi> 14.9. that he is angry againſt thoſe, that offend him. That Sin enkindles his Fury and Indignation. <hi>Iratus eſt furore Dominus in populum tuum, &amp; abominatus eſt haeriditatem ſuam. Pſal.</hi> 105.40. The whole Scripture is full of theſe expreſſions, which give us plainly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that Sin which hath cauſed a diſorder in all Gods creatures, hath not ſpared the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and that this Infernall Monſter, as much as poſſible, attaques God himſelf, and were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, would deſtroy him.</p>
                     <p>It is true, <hi>Theotime,</hi> (and this we ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well in this place) that theſe different af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which the Scripture attributes to God, in reſpect of Sin, are not to be found in God in the ſame manner, as in men; for they cauſe in men a diſcompoſure of the mind, from whence they are call'd Paſſions, or the ſufferings of the Soul; but they make no ſuch change in God, who being unchangeable cannot be moved, or ſuffer by different affections. When therefore in Scripture it is ſaid, that God for example, is touched with Grief, Hatred, Anger, and the like, this is to be underſtood, as Divines expreſs it, no further then as to what concerns the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our effects, which appear to us, and are ſuch, as are amongſt us the uſual effects of a ſorrowfull &amp; angry mind; and not as to any change of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which in God is none. <hi>Quantum ad effectum, non quantum ad affectum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is no hindrance, but that we may draw from theſe paſſages of Scripture, infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to prove the enormity of Mortal Sin.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:38446:53"/>For it is reaſonable to judge of the malice of a cauſe, by the evil effects, which of its own nature it is capable to produce; although it happen that the effect may not follow, by reaſon of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal impediment. Sin therefore of it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable to produce in God all thoſe Paſſions, we have ſpoken of, tho' his Sovereign perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on renders him uncapable to receive them; this doth not diminiſh in the leaſt the malice of it; which is always ſuch, that in as much as in it lies, it produceth in God all thoſe paſſions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites in him Grief, Sadneſs, Hatred, Anger, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Indignation.</p>
                     <p>O Sin, how wicked and cruel art thou! ſince thou haſt no regard to God himſelf; but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureſt to attaque that Sovereign Majeſty, even in his Throne of Glory. A <hi>Prophet</hi> once ſaid; let <hi>Samaria</hi> be deſtroy'd, becauſe it hath raiſed bitterneſs and ſadneſs to his God. <hi>Pereat Samaria, quia ad amaritudinem concitavit Deum ſuum, Oſea.</hi> 14. But with how much greater reaſon ought we to ſay, that Sin ſhould for ever periſh, ſeeing it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taques even God himſelf, and in as much as in it lies, fills that infinite Ocean of Sweetneſs and Bounty with Gall and Bitterneſs.</p>
                     <p>Behold, <hi>Theotime,</hi> the reaſons we have to deteſt and abhor Sin, from whence we may form to our ſelves a motive of true <hi>Contrition;</hi> Behold how we are to deteſt Sin, not only by reaſon of the evils which it heaps upon us, whereof we have ſpoken above; but for the evils with which it affects even God himſelf, for once it is capable to cauſe all thoſe effects in God, (altho' it doth not effectually produce them, for the reaſon above mentioned) it follows of neceſſity, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38446:53"/>which it offers to God, is dreadfully beyond meaſure great.</p>
                     <p>Conclude then with a ſtrong reſolution, to hate this enemy of God, this, if poſſible, diſturber of the Deity.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICLE VI.</hi> Of the Effects of Sin in the Perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THat which Sin could not effect in God, it hath brought about in his only Son our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and if the Divinity, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it's infinite perfections, be raiſed above the attempts of the malice of this Infernal Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the moſt ſacred humanity of the Son of God hath ſuffer'd for all, beyond all that which we can either ſpeak, or think. Conſider this well, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and obſerve once more the enormity of Mortal Sin, by the number and greatneſs of thoſe evils, which it made him to ſuffer, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſatisfy for it, and deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p>Conſider firſt, that it was Sin which made the Son of God deſcend from Heaven; that is, which obliged him to take our humanity upon him, and ſtoop to that wonderfull abaſement of his Perſon, (which St. <hi>Paul</hi> called annihilation, or becoming nothing. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.9.) as to make himſelf Man for us and our Salvation; to take the habit and form of a Servant, to put himſelf in a capacity to ſatisfy the Divine Juſtice for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite injury done him by Mortal Sin: An injury never to be repaired, but by one who ſhould be God and Man.</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:38446:54"/>
                     <p>Secondly, this adorable Myſtery of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was no ſooner accompliſhed, but the firſt thought of the Son of God made Man was to offer himſelf to his Eternal Father, a Sacrifice to the Divine Juſtice in ſatisfaction for all the Sins of Men, as he himſelf ſaid by the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.7. The Sacrifices, and all Holocauſts which hitherto have been offered to appeaſe thy wrath againſt ſin, were not able to give thee ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: wherefore I am come, and knowing that it was thy will that I ſhould ſatisfy. I am content, O my God! and embrace with all my heart, this thy good pleaſure, and decree.</p>
                     <p>From that firſt moment even untill the time of the Paſſion of the Son of God, his life was a continual Sacrifice which he offered to his Father; the divine love always burning, &amp; never permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him any repoſe, untill he had accompliſhed the work he came for; untill by his death he had conquer'd, and deſtroy'd, that cruel Enemy he came to fight with, which was ſin. This is that, which he himſelf teſtified, when he ſaid, <hi>I have a Baptiſm, wherewith I am to be Baptized, and how am I ſtreightned</hi> interiourly <hi>untill it be diſpatcht.</hi> Luk. 12.5.</p>
                     <p>He who could recount the pains and travels of the life of the Son of God, his faſt, his preaching, his watchings, his prayers, and all that which he hath done and ſuffered, as well in Soul, as body, during the 33 years of his mortal Life, would eaſily perceive, how all that tended to the deſtruction of ſin, for which he principally came into the world.</p>
                     <p>The time at length approaching, wherein he was to enter into that laſt Combat of that ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:38446:54"/>great and ſignal War, which he was come to wage to free us all from ſin, and the captivity of the Devil its firſt Author; what was he not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do and ſuffer that he might conquer ſo potent an enemy? it is true that he gained a glorious victory, but it was with the loſs of his precious life, and at the price of his own death. But what death, <hi>Theotime?</hi> A death full both of ſorrows and reproaches, the death of the Croſs: A death accompanied with all imaginable affronts, and executed by thoſe that he had in the higheſt degree obliged; betrayed and delivered by one of his Diſciples to his mortal enemies; abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo and denied by his own Diſciples; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rained before a Judge; accuſed as a Criminal; Sentenced and condemned as a Malefactor; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſcoffs and deriſions of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Before his execution he was Scourged with no leſs cruelty, then ſhame and diſgrace: deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over to the inſolence of Soldiers, who Crowned him with Thorns as a mock-King, in deriſion and ſcorn. In fine, led to execution, nailed to the Croſs, expoſed to the view of all the world between two Thieves, as if he had been an Impoſtor, a Cheat, and the worſt of men. Amidſt theſe exceſſive pains of his Body, and yet far greater anguiſhes of his Soul, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſorrow and confuſion, he expires upon the Croſs, and commends his Spirit into his hands, who ſent him.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Theotime,</hi> have you ever ſeriouſly thought of theſe ſufferings of the Son of God, your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? But perhaps you have not reflected upon that which cauſed them; wonder at his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but be not ſurpriſed, if I tell you, that it is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:38446:55"/>nothing elſe but Sin: It was Sin alone that Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Son of God. It is true they were the <hi>Jews,</hi> who perſecuted him to death; it was <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> who condemned him, and the Executioners who nailed him on the Croſs: It is alſo moſt true that he offer'd himſelf unto death, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent all theſe hardſhips, becauſe he was ſo pleaſed; <hi>Oblatus eſt quia ipſe voluit. Iſa.</hi> 53. It is moreover moſt certain that his Eternal Father deſired that of him, and obliged him to drink that bitter Chalice: But it is alſo without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that Sin was the firſt cauſe of the ſuffering of the Son of God; it was that which firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him, this alſo was his moſt cruel Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. If he offer'd himſelf to death, it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had willingly charged himſelf with our Sins. If the Eternal Father would alſo have him ſuffer, it was to receive from him the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was due to his Divine Juſtice upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Sin. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſaias, c.</hi> 53. <hi>had laid on him all our Iniquities.</hi> And the Eternal Father himſelf ſaid, that <hi>he had ſtrucken him for the Sins of his people. Propter ſcelus populi percuſſi eum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hearken here to the deſcription, which the ſame Prophet makes, ſpeaking of the torments of the Son of God, which he ſaw, as clearly in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as if he had beheld them in effect. <hi>There was no Beauty in him, nor comelineſs, and we have ſeen him despiſed, and moſt abject of Men, a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and knowing infirmities, and his look as it were hid and despiſed; whereupon neither have we eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. He ſurely hath born our infirmities, and our ſorrows he hath carryed, and we have thought him as it were a leper, and Stricken of God, and humbled. And he was wounded for our iniquities, he was broken for our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:38446:55"/>ſins. The diſcipline of our peace upon him, and with his Stripes we are healed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> how much our ſins have made Jeſus Chriſt to ſuffer. Behold to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that cruel enemy hath reduced the Son of God: Is not this ſufficient to make us judge of the Greatneſs and enormity of Mortall Sin, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath made him to ſuffer ſo great torments, who had undertaken to deſtroy it, ſeeing alſo the fault could not be expiated, nor the damage repaired, but by the death of God made man, whoſe ſole life is infinitely more eſtimable and precious then thoſe of all Men, Angels, and other poſſible creatures put together? Ought we not then to ſay that the wounds we have received by Sin, are truly dreadfull, ſince they could not be cured by any thing leſs then the blood of the Son of God? <hi>Agnoſce homo, quam gravia ſint nulnera, pro quibus neceſſe fuit unigenitum Dei filium vulnerari. Si non eſſent haec ad mortem, &amp; ad mortem, ſempiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, nunquam prohis filius Dei moreretur.</hi> Bern. Serm. 3. de Nat. Dom. <hi>O man</hi> (ſaith St Bernard) <hi>acknowledge how great thoſe gaſhes were, that obliged the only Son of God to be wounded to cure them. If thoſe Sores had not been mortall, and the cauſes of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, the Son of God had never dyed for their recovery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Can there be a more conſiderable motive to lament and abhorr our ſins, then when we reflect that they were the cauſe why the Son of God our Saviour Suffered ſo much, and alſo why he died upon the Croſs? The <hi>Jews</hi> once wept over, and bewail'd the deſtruction of the Royal City of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> becauſe of the loſs of their King; <hi>Cecidit corona capitis noſtri: vae nobis, quia peccanimus!
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:38446:56"/>Thren.</hi> 5. How much more reaſon have we to lament our misfortune who by our ſins are the only cauſe of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, our King, our Redeemer, and our Glory?</p>
                     <p>Weigh well, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and meditate upon this motive of ſorrow and contrition; it will pierce your heart, except it be harder, and more obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate then the very Stones; and ſay with St Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, <hi>ubi ſupra. Pudet itaque, dilectiſſimi, propriam negligenter diſſimulare paſſionem, cui tantam a maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate tantâ video exhiberi compaſſionem. Compatitur filius Dei, &amp; plorat; homo patitur, &amp; ridebit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is a ſhamefull thing for Chriſtians not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the evils, which ſin hath brought upon them, when they conſider, what ſo ſupreme a Majeſty, as that of the Son of God, hath been obliged to ſuffer for them. The Son of God takes compaſſion on the miſeries of man, and weeps for ſorrow; whilſt inſenſible man, who is overwhelmed with his own Sins, is not concern'd at all.</hi> O <hi>Theotime,</hi> have a care, I will not ſay only, that you never become ſo blind and inſenſible, as to flight the grievouſneſs and enormity of mortall Sin, but that you never permit a day to paſs, in which with all the vigour of your heart, you do not conceive new hatred againſt that infernall Monſter, which could not be deſtroyed, but by the paſſion and death of the Son of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>

                  <p>LEt us now reſume all that, which we have ſaid concerning the Motives of <hi>Contrition,</hi> ſince the Eighth Chapter, that we may come to the practice of this great Virtue, without which it is impoſſible to be juſtifyed in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>We have ſaid that to have <hi>Contrition,</hi> we muſt know the enormity or grievouſneſs of Mortall Sin, and we have made that Enormity appear from ſeveral heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it is incomprehenſible in it ſelf, as we ſhewed in the Eighth Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> From the knowledge we have of it from the Sacred Scripture, which diſcovers unto us the ſeveral Signal and moſt enormous indignities of Sin; whilſt it treats of it, as a Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; a deteſtable ingratitude; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Holy will, a poſtponing the Creator to the Creature, and a preferring of our own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the will of God; which we ſpoke of in the <hi>9th,</hi> Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> From the horrid offence or injury which by Sin is done to God; an injury really infinite, and ſo great, that no pure Creature, either Man, or Angel is capable by himſelf to make ſatisfaction for it; As we have ſeen in the <hi>10th.</hi> Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4ly.</hi> From the dreadfull effects, which by ſin are cauſed in all places and in all ſorts of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; in Heaven, in Earth, in Hell; in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:38446:57"/>in Man, in God himſelf, and in his Son Jeſus Chriſt; as we have ſhewed in the ſeveral Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>11th,</hi> Chapter.</p>
                  <p>After all theſe Motives thus treated, to give you an inſight into the nature of that ſorrow, which is called <hi>Contrition</hi> of your Sins, you muſt read over theſe ſame Motives with much attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on again and again, not once or twice, but many times; you muſt begg continually of God that he will vouchſafe to grant you his Grace to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them well, and that your Soul may be moved with them: in reading them you muſt pauſe ſome time upon thoſe which touch you moſt; you muſt weigh them well, and imprint them in your heart: and having underſtood them, caſt your ſelf upon your knees, and deplore your Sins in the preſence of God, upon thoſe motives which you conceived beſt, and which affected you moſt; demand of him pardon, and beſeech him to ſhew his mercy toward you, making uſe of this, or the like prayer.</p>
                  <p>O my God! have pitty on me, and let me partake of the effects of thy great mercy. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge now the evil, which I have done, and apprehend the grievouſneſs of my Sins. Thou art he, O my God, whom I have offended; whom I have attacqued, rebellious, ungratefull, and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Creature, as I am. Thee have I aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to follow my pleaſures and paſſions; I have loſt thy grace; and I, who have been created to thy Image and likeneſs, by my Sins have made my foul like unto thoſe monſters of ingratitude, the Devils. I have loſt Heaven my bleſſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; I have merited Hell and Eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I ſhall never be able to avoid without
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:38446:57"/>the aſſiſtance of thy great mercy. But above all I have infinitely offended thy bounty. The injury which I have offered it, is ſo great, that it cauſed thy Son Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour to ſuffer death. O my God! how can I worthily deplore ſo great an evil! who will give water to my head, and a fountain of Tears unto my eyes to deplore night and day my miſery and malice, and to do Penance for my ſins?</p>
                  <p>Make this or the like prayer; but make it from the bottom of your ſoul; make it with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contrite heart in the preſence of God, in acknowledgment of your ſins and miſery. Run it not over briefly; take time to make it; make it long, and for many days: Put your ſelf in the State of a true Penitent in the ſight of God, and, that you may perform it better, make uſe of this means, which I ſhall give you.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of Examples of Penance taken out of Holy Writ.</head>
                  <p>ALltho' what we have ſaid may be very effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to excite <hi>Contrition,</hi> and a true ſorrow for our Sins; yet we will add in this place another means, which without queſtion muſt needs be more efficacious. They are ſome Examples of true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, which we find in the Holy Scripture, as well in the Old, as New Teſtament. Theſe are the true models, by which we may frame ours, and learn what is true Penance, and how to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it. Reade then, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and attend.</p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:38446:58"/>
                  <p>Conſider <hi>David</hi> after his Sin, how full of interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our trouble and concern he was for the evil he had done; bedewing, as he ſaith, his bed with his tears, and having always his Sins before his eyes, demanding mercy of God, and beſeeching him to turn away his eyes from his Iniquities, not to take away from him his Holy Spirit; not to contemn the Sacrifice, which he offer'd him, of an afflicted mind, of an humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart. Behold a true Penitent, behold what true <hi>Contrition</hi> is. <hi>Vade &amp; fac ſimiliter.</hi> Imitate this Example, and you are a true Penitent. You will find theſe excellent diſpoſitions of a penitent mind in the ſeven Penitential Pſalms, if you reade them wth attention. Behold King <hi>Ezechias</hi> weeping and lamenting in the preſence of God, and promiſing him to paſs again over in his heart, and in the bitterneſs of his Soul all his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent years, to bewail his Sins, and obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them. Reade his Canticle which begins <hi>Ego dixi in dimidio. Eſai.</hi> 38. Caſt your eyes upon the good <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were ſent Captives into <hi>Babilon</hi> after the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> doing Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for their Sins, which had thrown them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that miſerable ſtate; crying out to God from the bottom of their hearts, <hi>Baruch.</hi> 2. <hi>We have ſinned againſt the Lord our God in not obeying his word. To the Lord our God belongs juſtice and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs; but to us nothing but ſhame and confuſion,</hi> which our iniquities have deſerved: <hi>We have ſinned, we have done evil, we have dealt unjuſtly, O Lord our God, in all thy Commandments. Turn from us thy anger; hear, O Lord, our Prayers, and our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; open thy eyes and conſider that the dead praiſe thee not, but the Soul which is ſenſible and afflicted
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:38446:58"/>with the greatneſs of the evils ſhe hath done,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms due Penance for them.</p>
                  <p>Conſider <hi>Manaſſes</hi> alſo in his Converſion groaning under the weight of his Sins, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his Iniquities with ſuch a ſorrow, that he acknowledged himſelf unworthy even to lift up his eyes towards Heaven; ſo great, he confeſt, were his offences! You will perceive theſe words to proceed from a truly penitent Soul, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſorrow for his Sins. <hi>Oratio Manaſſes.</hi> 'Tis true, O Lord, I have infinitely offended thee, and my Sins are more in number then the Sand of the Sea; I am unworthy to lift up my eyes towards Heaven to demand thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, having provoked thy anger, as I have done, by my Iniquities: But now, O my God, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate my ſelf from my heart before thee to beg thy mercy. I have ſinned, O my God, I have ſinned: I acknowledge all the evil I have done, pardon, O Lord, pardon. I beg of thee, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeech thee, do not deſtroy me with my Iniquities; do not reſerve me to the utmoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of thy Juſtice; do not condemn me for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto the fire of Hell: Remember that thou art my God; the God of Penitents, and thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe bounty will beſt appear in me, whilſt it makes thee to ſave a miſerable Sinner unworthy of thy grace, and gives me occaſion to praiſe thee eternally for thy infinite goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>Go to the Goſpel, and there you will find more preſſing examples of Penance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</p>
                  <p>There you may ſee a holy Penitent, moved to that degree with ſorrow for her Sins, that ſhe ſeeks the Son of God, and having found him,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:38446:59"/>caſts her ſelf at his feet, waſhes them with her tears, (ſuch was the compunction of her heart, and ſo abundantly did they flow) wipes them with her hair, and annoints them with precious Ointment: thus conſecrating theſe Riches, that Hair, thoſe Tears to pious uſes, which till then ſhe had employ'd in vanity. And thus that ſorrow, ſhe had ſo happily conceived, broke forth into all the Signs of the love of God, and ſpared nothing to ſerve him, from whom ſhe expected the remiſſion of her Sins. So that She deſerved to hear from the mouth of our Saviour. <hi>Luc.</hi> 7.47. that <hi>her Sins were forgiven her, becauſe ſhe loved much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There you ſhall find the head of the Apoſtles unfortunately fall'n, denying his divine Maſter three ſeveral times. But he had ſcarce ended his laſt denial, when our Saviour by a glance of his eye which penetrated <hi>Peters</hi> heart, makes him to remember himſelf, acknowledge his fault, and conceive ſo great a grief, that <hi>going out he wept bitterly</hi> for the Sin. <hi>Egreſſus foras flevit amare. Mat.</hi> 26.75. And the grief continued all his life.</p>
                  <p>You will find in the Goſpel two other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of true penance, which the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf propoſed in two parables, which he ſet forth for that intent.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is in the perſon of the Prodigal Son, under which figure he ſets before our eyes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect pattern of a Sinner returning again to God by means of Penance. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. This poor ſtrayed young man after he had ſpent all his Eſtate, is forced by the ſenſe of his miſeries to reflect, or return to himſelf, and ſay; <hi>O how many hired Servants are there in my Fathers houſe, who abound with bread, and live at caſe, and I miſerable wretch am ready to ſtarve
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:38446:59"/>with hunger. I will ariſe, and go to my Father, and ſay, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, I am not now worthy to be called your Son, permit me only to be like one of your hired Servants.</hi> He had no ſooner ſpoke theſe words, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently without delay he puts them in execution; Leaves the place of his miſery, comes and caſts himſelf at his Fathers feet, to beg pardon and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at his hands; and ſuch and ſo great was this his repentance; that whereas he only demanded a place amongſt his Servants, he was admitted unto that of his Son which he had loſt.</p>
                  <p>Conſider well this pattern, <hi>Theotime,</hi> imitate it in your Repentance, and return to God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Practice well that, which is ſignified by theſe words, <hi>in ſe reverſus; returning into himſelf;</hi> for one muſt return into ones ſelf to return to God; that is to ſay, one muſt acknowledge the miſerable condition, to which he is reduced by Sin; the diſtance from God, the loſs of his grace, the lack of Spiritual favours, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of Divine Inſpirations; and above all, the continual danger of Damnation, wherein one is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in this view of your miſery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a horrour of it, and form in your heart a prompt and firm reſolution to return unto your Heavenly Father, in thoſe words of the Prodigal Son, <hi>Surgam &amp; ibo ad Patrem: I will riſe</hi> from my miſery, <hi>and I will go towards my</hi> Eternal <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> I will declare my fault, and ask him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſubmitting my ſelf in all things to his will.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, do not deferr, no more then the Prodigal Son, the performance of your reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; begin immediately and in earneſt to do Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for your Sins: Proſtrate your ſelf in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:38446:60"/>preſence of God, and beg his pardon, prepare your ſelf for a good Confeſſion, uſing all the neceſſary means to make it well: and in this Confeſſion, or even before, make uſe often of thoſe words of the Prodigal. <hi>Pater! peccavi in Coelum &amp; coram te, jam non ſum dignus vocari filius tuns: fac me ſicut unum de mercenariis tuis.</hi> But ponder well what they ſignify; for by thoſe words you profeſs to God that you have grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offended his Fatherly bounty; that, as a degenerate Child, you have abuſed all his graces; that you have not been aſhamed to affront him even in his prefence, and in the ſight of the whole Court of Heaven; that you acknowledge your ſelf unworthy to appear before him, or from thence forward to be treated by him, as his Child; that you only implore his mercy and the pardon of your Sins, proteſting to ſerve him faithfully from henceforward, to do Penance and accompliſh all his Commands, as a good and faithfull Servant. O what an excellent pattern is this, <hi>Theotime,</hi> if you did but know how to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it well.</p>
                  <p>The other example is that of the Publican; in whoſe perſon the Son of God hath again repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the life, the diſpoſitions, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in a true Penitent: And that he might ſet it forth to the beſt advantage, behold over againſt him a falſe or feigned Penitent, who had nothing in him, beſides an appearance or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull ſhew of Penance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Two men</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.) <hi>went up into the Temple to pray, the one was a Phariſee, the other a Publican; the Phariſee ſtanding prayed thus with himſelf: O God, I give thee thanks, that I am not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:38446:60"/>like other men, Thieves, Adulterers, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, as alſo this Publican; I faſt twice a week, I pay exactly the tenths of all my goods.</hi> Behold an example of a feign'd Penitent, who hath no ſorrow for his own ſins, but who looks more into the ſins of others, then his own; who juſtifies himſelf by the ſins he hath not committed, inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning himſelf for thoſe he is guilty of: who eſteems himſelf juſt before God, when he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from ſome certain ſins, altho' he commit others, and ſometimes greater. Who thinks he ſufficiently ſatisfies for his ſins by ſome exterior good works, as faſting, and the like, neglecting in the mean time, Penance of heart, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. Behold the Idea of a falſe Penitent, which is but too frequently found amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Look now upon the Picture of a true one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>On the contrary,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>the Publican ſtanding afar off would not ſo much as lift up his Eyes to Heaven; but knockt his breaſt, ſaying, God have mercy upon me Miſerable Sinner.</hi> In this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample are ſet forth all the diſpoſitions of a true Penitent.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a profound humility, which made him ſtay below in the Temple at a diſtance, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from others, as if he apprehended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by reaſon of his ſins unworthy to approach to God, or intermix himſelf amongſt the juſt. <hi>But by how much he retired farther off in himſelf, by ſo much,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine, he approached nearer to God. Publicanus autem, de longinquo ſtabat, &amp; Deo tamen ipſe propinquabat; cordis conſcientia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movebat, pietas applicabat.</hi> Serm. 36. de verſ. Dom.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſhame and confuſion he had to appear before God with a Conſcience loaden
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:38446:61"/>with ſins: a confuſion ſo great, that it hindred him from raiſing his Eyes towards Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ſorrow he had in his heart for having grievouſly offended God, in token where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he knocks his breaſt, <hi>denoting</hi> by that <hi>action,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Ciprian</hi>) <hi>the ſins concealed within. Sed percutiebat pectus ſuum, ut peccata intus incluſa teſtaretur. De Orat. Dominica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the pardon he emplored of God, as a true Penitent, having no other motive but his own unworthineſs on the one ſide, and on the other the pure mercy of God, by which alone he hoped for pardon, and not by his own Merits.</p>
                  <p>Behold, <hi>Theotime,</hi> Examples and patterns of true Penance, by which we ought to form and model ours. They are propoſed to us by the Holy Ghoſt for that end: and the two laſt were drawn, and formed by the Son of God, to teach us how to behave our ſelves in that great action. For this reaſon if you reſolve upon Penance, and a ſerious Converſion; you muſt read them attentively; Conſider exactly all and every one of their actions, ſo to conform your ſelf to them, as near as you can. And as you have imitated thoſe Penitents in their Sins and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances; ſo alſo imitate them in their Penance. As St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid to a great Emperour: <hi>Qui ſecutus es errantem, ſequere poenitentem.</hi>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Inſtitution and Neceſſity of Confeſſion.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt thing, which is neceſſary to be known in this place, is, who it was that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Confeſſion, and of what neceſſity it is for the Salvation of Souls.</p>
                  <p>We cannot better learn theſe two truths then from the Holy Church, which hath clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd them by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Seſſ. 14. Chap. 1.</p>
                  <p>The Council ſaith, that Pennance was always neceſſary, before the law of Grace, for all thoſe who had ſinned Mortally, and that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:38446:62"/>receive the remiſſion of their Sins, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and hatred of Sin, and a holy ſorrow of mind for the enormous offence they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt God: Yet that this Virtue was not raiſed to the dignity of a Sacrament, before the coming of the Son of God, who inſtituted it on the day of his Reſurrection, when being in the midſt of the Apoſtles <hi>he breathed on them,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, and ſaid theſe words: <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins you remit they are remitted, and whoſe ſins you retain they are retained.</hi> Jo. 20.23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By this ſo remarkable an action,</hi> ſaith the Council, <hi>and by thoſe ſo diſtinct words, the Fathers with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent have always underſtood, that the power to remit, or retain Sins, was given to the Apoſtles and their Lawfull Succeſſors, to reconcile thoſe unto God, who had fall'n into Sin after Baptiſm. Con. Tred. Seſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>And in the fifth Chapter, treating of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and neceſſity of the Confeſſion of Sins, which is the Second part of this Sacrament, it ſpeaks in theſe terms. <hi>Concerning the Inſtitution of the Sacrament of Penance already explicated; The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Church hath always underſtood, that our Lord inſtituted the Entire Confeſſion of Sins, and that it is neceſſary by divine right for all thoſe who have fall'n into Mortall Sin after Baptiſm. Becauſe our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>being ready to Aſcend into Heaven hath left Prieſts in his place in Quality of Preſidents and Judges, to whom all the Sins which the Faithfull had committed after Baptiſm, ought to be diſcovered, that they might give their Judgment, either of Abſolution or Retention, by Vertue of that power, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all this Doctrine of the Holy Church we
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:38446:62"/>learn two truths: The firſt is, that Confeſſion is is inſtituted by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The ſecond, that it is neceſſary by Divine right for the remiſſion of Mortal Sins committed after Baptiſm, as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is neceſſary for the remiſſion of Original Sin.</p>
                  <p>We muſt notwithſtanding take notice that in caſe of neceſſity, and where Confeſſion is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, it may be ſupplied by Contrition, as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is alſo ſupplied by the ſame action in thoſe, who are capable to make it, ſuppoſing that in this Contrition be included a will to receive Baptiſm, or make a Confeſſion: But in this caſe it is neceſſary that the Contrition be perfect, and proceed from the pure love of God.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> What is Sacramental Confeſſion?</head>
                  <p>THis word Confeſſion is underſtood two ways in Scripture, for ſometimes it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the praiſe of God, ſometimes the accuſation of Sins; and the reaſon is, becauſe that word ſignifies an avouching, and an acknowledgment; and to Confeſs ſignifies to avouch or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any thing. When we acknowledge the greatneſs of God or his benefits, this is called Confeſſion, which ſignifies as much as praiſe or benediction which we give to God: When we acknowledge the Sins we have committed, it is a Confeſſion by which we accuſe our ſelyes. This made St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſay that Confeſſion belongs not only to Sinners, who accuſe themſelves, but alſo

                  <p>We ſpeak here in this place only of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sins, and of that only as it is a part of the Sacrament of Penance, which we define thus: <hi>An accuſation of all the Sins one has committed which is made to the Prieſt as Vicar of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Abſolution thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this definition we muſt particularly take notice of the word <hi>Accuſation,</hi> which ſignifies much, but ordinarily is but little underſtood: for it doth not ſignify a ſimple recital of their Sins, as it happens to the greateſt part of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, who Confeſs their Sins, as if they were recounting a Story: This word then betokens quite another thing, and means a declaration which the Penitent makes of his Sins to the Prieſt, as a Criminal to his Judge, that is, to denounce them, to acknowledge ones ſelf guilty, and to blame ones ſelf, to demand pardon for them, profeſſing a regret or trouble of mind for having committed them, proteſting not to offend any
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38446:63"/>more; and ſubmitting ones ſelf to the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Puniſhments the Judge ſhall pleaſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>Behold what, properly ſpeaking, Sacramental Confeſſion is; which is much different from that which is frequently practiſed by Penitents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is rightly called,</hi> (ſaith the learned Catechiſm of the Council of <hi>Trent. de Penitent. n.</hi> 51.) <hi>an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, becauſe Sins are not to be ſo recounted as tho' we boaſted of our wickedneſs; nor are they to be ſo told, as if for divertiſement to ſome idle hearers we were telling a Story. But they are ſo to be declared by a mind accuſing it ſelf, as that we deſire alſo to revenge them in our ſelves.</hi> That is, we muſt accuſe our ſelves with the ſpirit, and diſpoſition of a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal before his Judge.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> above-cited ſaith, that the Sacrament of Penance is inſtituted by the Son of God as a Tribunal and Judgment, where the Sins of the Faithfull muſt be diſcovered before the Prieſt; who ought to judge them, and where the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by conſequence ought to appear as culpable: Now he cannot appear as ſuch, if he be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and he cannot be accuſed, but by himſelf: the declaration then of his Sins muſt be ſuch an <hi>Accuſation</hi> as we have ſpoken of, being it is made with this intent to obtain remiſſion, and pardon.</p>

                  <p>IT is eaſy to form a judgment of them from the precedent definition: For being it is an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, it follows, that it ought to have two Conditions amongſt others: It muſt be <hi>entire,</hi> that is, of all the Sins they have committed, and it muſt be made with <hi>ſorrow</hi> for having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them. He who accuſes himſelf, that he may obtain pardon, muſt accuſe himſelf of all the evils he hath done, and teſtify the ſorrow he hath for his faults.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Conditions require or produce ſome others: for the <hi>Integrity</hi> requires it ſhould be <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Short:</hi> the ſorrow produceth a <hi>ſhame</hi> for having ſinned, and a <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to the will of the perſon offended, that he may obtain pardon upon what conditions he ſhall beſt think fit.</p>
                  <p>Thus one may put ſix conditions neceſſary for a good Confeſſion. It ought to be <hi>Entire, Clear, Short,</hi> made with confuſion and <hi>Shame</hi> of the Evil, with <hi>Sorrow</hi> for having committed them, and with <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to the perſon offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; this Latin Verſe will make you remeber them.</p>

                  <p>It ought to be <hi>Entire,</hi> that is, of all the Sins they remember, after a diligent and ſufficient
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:38446:64"/>Examen. This is to be underſtood of Mortal Sins; and without this condition the Confeſſion is null. The reaſon is becauſe Mortal Sins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pardoned ſeparately one without another, being they are all and every one oppoſite to Sanctifying Grace, and any one amongſt them remaining in the Soul, it is an hindrance, not permitting Grace to enter there; whence it follows, that if one conceal but one only Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin in Confeſſion, the Sacrament cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce its effects, which is the Sanctification of the Soul, by the infuſion of Grace.</p>
                  <p>It ought to be <hi>Clear,</hi> that is, in terms eaſy and intelligible, as much as the Penitent is able, who ought to have a ſincere will to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf underſtood by his Confeſſor, and therefore he muſt as much as may be avoid obſcurity; at leaſt he is obliged not to affect, or deſire to be obſcure; for this would be an evident ſign that he hath a mind to conceal ſome Sins.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be <hi>Short,</hi> not to ſay any more then what is neceſſary to make himſelf rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and to avoid ſuperfluous words, the repeating the ſame thing, and unprofitable Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are but too frequent amongſt Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. He muſt ſimply tell his ſins in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I accuſe my ſelf that I have committed ſuch a Sin: and adding only that which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make the Confeſſor underſtand the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſin, or anſwering to the queſtion he ſhall ask to inform himſelf.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be <hi>Shamefaced,</hi> that is, expreſſed with civil and modeſt words, and with an interior ſentiment of confuſion for having offended God. A confuſion which makes us bluſh to ſee our
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:38446:65"/>ſelves criminal in the ſight of God; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making us by any means, conceal our ſins; but rather making us ingeniouſly and humbly to declare them to him who hath the place of God. For the Penitent, who acknowledges himſelf culpable in the ſight of God, hath no trouble to diſcover them before men: <hi>Juſtus prior eſt accuſator ſui.</hi> Prov. 18. <hi>The Juſt man,</hi> that is, he who deſires to become juſt, <hi>is the firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of himſelf.</hi> And that other Sentence of <hi>Iſaias,</hi> according to the <hi>Septuagint Verſion. Dic tu peccata ſua ut juſtificeris.</hi> Iſai. 43. <hi>Diſcover thy ſins that thou mayſt be juſtified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ought to be <hi>Sorrowfull,</hi> that is, with a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of grief and regret for the Sins he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf of; otherwiſe it would not be an Accuſation.</p>
                  <p>In fine, it muſt be <hi>Humble,</hi> that is, the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ought to acknowledge himſelf culpable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he deſerves to be puniſhed, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf unto the Conditions the Judge ſhall appoint for the remiſſion of his Sins.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Defects in Confeſſion.</head>
                  <p>AS we have ſaid, that there are ſix Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required, ſo alſo it is manifeſt that there are ſix Defects. The want of Sorrow, Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is notwithſtanding true, that every one of them do not make the Confeſſion null; but only the want of thoſe Conditions abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which are Integrity, and Contrition;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:38446:65"/>which we told you above were the two general Conditions from whence the others ſpring.</p>
                  <p>The want of Integrity renders the Confeſſion null, as alſo the want of true and neceſſary Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: and this is a certain Maxime, which we muſt hold in this matter: that there are two things neceſſary in the Penitent; entire Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and true Contrition. If one of theſe are wanting by the Penitents fault, the Sacrament is null, and the Confeſſion Sacrilegious.</p>
                  <p>The want of the other Conditions render the Confeſſion imperfect, but not invalid; except they be ſuch as deſtroy one of thoſe two Eſſential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; Integrity or Sorrow. Thus the defect of clearneſs may be ſuch, that it makes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour not underſtand all the Mortal Sins: and in that caſe it renders the Confeſſion null; and eſpecially if that obſcurity be affected and on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the want of obedience may be ſo great, that it deſtroys Contrition; and ſo of others.</p>
                  <p>Now there are three Caſes, where Integrity makes the Confeſſion defective. The firſt, when willingly and knowingly one conceals a Mortal Sin for ſhame, fear, negligence, or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, when one conceals it indirectly; as when one accuſes himſelf in terms obſcure, or ambiguous, with deſign that the Confeſſour ſhould not underſtand all that he would ſay, or at leaſt perceiving he did not underſtand every Mortal Sin; or when one accuſes himſelf by halfs, leaving the reſt to be gueſs'd at, or to be asked by the Confeſſour, which happens of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to young people.</p>
                  <p>The third, when one hath not made a ſufficient Examen of his Conſcience, but goes preſently
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:38446:66"/>to Confeſſion, knowing well enough he is not ſufficiently prepared: For altho' there be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between concealing and forgetting a Sin in Confeſſion; and that forgetfulneſs doth not make the Confeſſion invalid; yet this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood only, when the forgetfulneſs is not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or cauſed by our negligence: for when we are the cauſe of ſuch forgetfulneſs, it is certain it is a Sin, which renders the Confeſſion null, by the rule that he who deſires the cauſe, is judged alſo to deſire the effect, which infallibly follows it.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſorrow for Sins, there are many caſes wherein the Penitent may want it to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that the Sacrament is null thereby.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when one has made no act, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nor during Confeſſion, nor before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Abſolution: In this caſe the Confeſſion is invalid, altho' it may proceed from a pure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, that they did not perform that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe it is eſſential and abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Sacrament, and which cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by any other action.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when one makes thoſe acts, but without due conditions: as without ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motives, or with a reſerve or exception of ſome Mortal Sin, for which one hath a complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance or affection; in a word, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions we have ſpoken of before in the ſecond Part, fourth Chapter; which you muſt reade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again in this place.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when one hath not a ſincere reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of amendment, altho' he believes he hath; this is judged to happen, when the Penitent will not leave the occaſion of Sin, practice the neceſſary remedies, obey his Confeſſour in reaſonable things.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Conditions neceſſary to make the Confeſſion entire.</head>
                  <p>ACcording to the Doctrine of the Church there are three: To declare the Species or Nature of the Sin, the Number, and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that change the Species or Nature of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we muſt confeſs the Species, Sort, or Nature of the Sin: It is not ſufficient to ſay in general terms, I have ſinned, I have very much offended God; but we muſt tell particularly in what: I have, for example, committed Theft, or Blaſphemy, or Detraction.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this rule is given by the Holy Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> becauſe, ſays it, the Prieſts are conſtituted Judges in this Sacrament, to give a judgement of the ſins of men. Now it is manifeſt they cannot exerciſe that judgment without the knowledge of the Cauſe; nor obſerve the neceſſary equity in the enjoining of the Penance, except the Penitents declare their Sins in particular, and not only in general.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they muſt diſcover the number, that is, how often they have fall'n into each ſort of Sin. This is alſo abſolutely neceſſary, that the Confeſſor may judge aright: becauſe he, who hath committed a Sin often, is much more Culpable, then he who hath done it but ſeldom.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we muſt explain the circumſtances which change the Species or Nature of Sin, as the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:38446:67"/>ſame Council hath declared in expreſs terms; and this is to be done for the ſame reaſon, that obligeth us to confeſs the Sins of different Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or ſorts. Thus in Theft one muſt expreſs the circumſtance of a Sacred place, in which he robbed, or a Sacred thing, which he hath taken: becauſe this circumſtance changes the Species, and makes it a Sacriledge.</p>
                  <p>In the ſin of impurity, one muſt diſcover the quality of the perſon with whom he hath ſinned: whether it be a Single or Married Perſon, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, for theſe circumſtances make different ſins, of Fornication, Adultery, or Inceſt.</p>
                  <p>In fine, Penitents, and particularly young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are often defective in theſe three rules. For firſt, as to the Species, or nature of the Sin, it happens frequently, that they do not declare it at all. For example, concerning the ſin of Impurity, they ſay no more then that they have willingly entertain'd evil thoughts, without mentioning in the leaſt, whether they were accompanyed with any immodeſt touches of themſelves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects which follow; which are ſins of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Species, and more grievous then the thoughts. They will confeſs they have touched others unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, without diſcovering how, or what ſort of perſons. They will accuſe themſelves of Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Neighbour, but not offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the thing they have ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as to the number it happens often, that telling the Species they are afraid to diſcover the number intirely, and therefore conceal ſome part, the number ſometimes cauſing as much ſhame as the Species it ſelf and quality of the ſin. In which caſe the Confeſſion is no leſs invalid
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:38446:67"/>and Sacrilegious, then if they had concealed the very Species of the ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they frequently commit the ſame fault by the notable circumſtances, which they are afraid to diſcover. For example, if they have robbed, or done ſome notable injury to their Neighbours Goods, or cheated him at play, they are afraid to tell the quantity, leſt they ſhould be obliged to reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe occurrences when one willingly and wittingly conceals theſe notable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Confeſſion is null. Have a care, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to avoid theſe conſiderable faults, which often happen in Confeſſion, for want of diſcovering the Species or kind of the ſin, the number or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table circumſtances.</p>

                  <p>I Have here an advice of great concern to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part unto you, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſins. That is, to avoid in Confeſſion two extremes equally Vitious: the one is a Supine negligence; the other is too much exactneſs and ſcrupuloſity.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome, who that they may not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves with a juſt examen, diſcover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the number of Mortall Sins, or if they do, that which is very uncertain: I have done it for example, twenty times more or leſs, or elſe in declaring a greater number then they are guilty
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:38446:68"/>of, to comprehend therein the number they might have committed: this doth not ſatisfy the exactneſs which is neceſſary in Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Others on the contrary are ſo much troubled in the ſearch of their Sins, and the number of them, that they are never quiet, but vex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with continual doubts and anxiety of mind, never believing they have ſufficiently examined their Sins. This makes them that they think of nothing but this examen, and little or nothing of the principal concern, which is <hi>Contrition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two faults muſt neceſſarily be avoided. For the firſt may render the Confeſſion invalid for want of integrity; the other for want of <hi>Contrition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe who ſind themſelves guilty of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ought to remember what diligence is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to diſpoſe themſelves for a thing of ſuch high concern, as is the obtaining the remiſſion of their Sins; and ſince without confeſſing them all, as far as they are able to remember, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acquired; it is neceſſary they ſhould before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand apply, as much as poſſible, their mind and attention thereunto, to the end they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. This is the rule which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> gives in this matter. Seſ. 14. in the fifth Chapter of Confeſſion. <hi>Ex his colligitur oportere a panitentibus, omnia peccata Mortalia quorum poſt diligentem ſui diſcuſſionem conſcientiam habent, in confeſſione recenſeri, etiam ſi occultiſſima illa ſint. It is neceſſary,</hi> ſaith the Council, <hi>that the Penitents muſt declare all their Sins they remember after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent examen, even thoſe that are moſt hidden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to the others who trouble and diſquiet themſelves with the Examen of their Sins, they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:38446:68"/>are to be fully perſuaded of this truth; that God requires no more of them in this, or any other occaſion, but what they are able to perform; and that after they have done what morally ſpeaking they are able to remember their Sins, they ought to ſatisfy themſelves, to declare what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and reſt in quiet; it being moſt certain that other ſins which they have forgot are to be comprehended in that Confeſsion; and that they are pardoned them in the abſolution they receive.</p>
                  <p>This alſo is a rule of the Holy Church in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which condemns thoſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, who ſay that the Confeſsion of all their Sins, is an impoſsible thing, and a Torture or Hell of the Conſcience: being it is certain, ſaith the Council, that the Church requires no more of the Penitents, but that every one after he hath made a carefull Examen and ſearch into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Conſcience, ſhould Confeſs thoſe Sins which occurr to his memory: and that other Sins, which, notwithſtanding ſuch an Examen, they do not remember, are eſteemed generally to be comprehended in the ſame Confeſsion: and it is of theſe Sins we ſay to God with the Prophet: <hi>Cleanſe me from my hidden Sins, O Lord. Pſal.</hi> 18.13.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who embrace this maxime of the Church will eaſily find quiet of mind, and baniſh the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which ariſe from their Confeſsions. It is true, they are ſtill in doubt, whether in their Examen they uſed that diligence which the Church requires: We ſhall tell you hereafter in the ninth Chapter wherein it conſiſts; in the mean time I ſhall mind you of two things here for your comfort.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, that this great and obliging diligence
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:38446:69"/>reaches only to Mortal Sins. As for Venial Sins, as we are not in rigour obliged to Confeſs them, ſo likewiſe we are not to make ſuch an exact exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of them: and as it is an excellent thing to make the beſt Confeſſion we are able; ſo it is the part of a weak Soul to be troubled with ſcruples, and anxieties of mind.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Advertiſement is, that when, after a ſerious examen of our Sins, we cannot call to mind the number of them; as it happens in ſins of habit or cuſtom, which are frequently committed, as ill Thoughts, diſhoneſt Words, Oaths, and the like, it is ſufficient to diſcover, as near as one can, the time ſince he was firſt ſubject to it: and in that time to take notice, as much as may be, how often he may have fallen, if he have fallen often, as every day, every week, or otherwiſe; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one hath declared what he can in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he ought not to concern or trouble himſelf any further.</p>

                  <p>THE particular accidents which intervene, and are not of the ſubſtance of a deed, but only accompany it, are called the circumſtance of an action, as the quality of the perſon who ſins, the place, the time, the deſign with which he acted, the end which was propoſed, the means that were made uſe of, the conſequence and evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of an action, as Scandal or the like. All
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38446:69"/>which are comprehended in this verſe.</p>
                  <p>Quis? quid? ubi? quibus auxilij? cur? quomodo? quando?</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the circumſtances there are ſome which are light, which render not an action worſe then it is of it ſelf, and of theſe we do not ſpeak. There are others that are notorious and which aggravate exceedingly an action, and make it more heinous, which are thoſe of which we treat in this place. Now of theſe there are two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Some which aggravate a Sin to that degree that they change the Species or nature of it: thus the circumſtance of a Sacred place, or a Sacred thing which is ſtol'n, changes the Sin of theft into Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, which is a different Species or ſort of Sin.</p>
                  <p>Others aggravate only the ſin without chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Species, and are called ſimply aggravating Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>As to the former there is no queſtion, but it is neceſſary to declare them in <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> as we have ſaid above in the fifth Chapter. And for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there are authors, who hold one is not in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour obliged to confeſs them.</p>
                  <p>Altho' this opinion may be true in Speculation, yet in practice it is very difficult to make uſe of it, as one ought, by reaſon that it is very hard to diſcern well the Circumſtances which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occur. And this is the reaſon why not ſticking to this opinion, it is neceſſary that in practice we follow and obſerve theſe two Maxims.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt, that it is always better and more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to declare in <hi>Confeſſion</hi> the circumſtances
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38446:70"/>which aggravate the Sin.</p>
                  <p>The Second, that it happens frequently that one is obliged to declare them, as in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examples.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When one cannot diſcern whether a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which one believes to be notorious, change the ſin or no. And who is it except he be a very underſtanding perſon that knows this?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When it falls out that a circumſtance makes a ſin to be Mortall, which otherwiſe without it would be but Veniall. Thus to ſteal ſixpence is but a Venial ſin, but to ſteal ſixpence from a poor man that had nothing elſe to live upon, is a Mortall Sin. He who ſtrikes another and does him no hurt, commits but a venial ſin; but if in ſtriking him he had an intention to wound him notoriouſly, he commits a mortall Sin; and he ought to declare that intention, when he accuſeth himſelf that he hath ſtrook him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. One is alſo obliged to tell the aggravating circumſtances, when it chanceth that a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance aggravates a mortall ſin, not only notably but extreamly and with exceſs. For example: A man who hath robbed five pounds hath ſinned mortally; another who hath ſtoll'n twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, hath alſo committed a Mortall ſin, but imcomparably a greater. This exceſs ought to be expreſſed in <hi>Confeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. This declaration is ordinarily neceſſary, that the Confeſſor may underſtand the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſin, and the ſtate of the Penitent, without which he can neither impoſe a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Penance for the ſins paſt, nor preſcribe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to avoid them for the future.</p>
                  <p>In fine, to declare ingeniouſly his ſins with all
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:38446:70"/>their circumſtances is a ſign of a ſincere and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penitent heart, deſirous to cure his Maladies, and ſave his Soul.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon, <hi>Theotime,</hi> when you accuſe your ſelf of a ſin, explicate diſtinctly and clearly the circumſtances, which ſeem to render it more grievous in the ſight of God. For example, how you did it; whether by paſſion or malice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an intention to hurt another or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him; whether any ſcandal, or any other ill effect followed from the ſin; whether it was in a holy place, or the like: And anſwer always with much ſincerity to the queſtions which your Ghoſtly Father ſhall ask you concerning your ſins.</p>

               <div n="8" type="chapter">
                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> How great an evil it is to conceal a Mortal Sin in <hi>Confeſſion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Would to God this evil were as rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of amongſt Chriſtians, as it is great in it ſelf, and of moſt dreadfull conſequence to thoſe that commit it. But it happens by a ſtrange mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, that it is but too common amongſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, and particularly amongſt ſimple and young people, by reaſon they know not how grievous a ſin it is, and the dreadfull conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it draws after it. This is the reaſon why I treat of it in this place.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, <hi>Theotime,</hi> you muſt know, and hold as moſt certain, that to conceal willingly in Confeſſion any Mortal Sin, or what you believe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:38446:71"/>is a Mortal Sin, is alſo a Mortal Sin: The reaſon is taken from the Command of our Saviour, who, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> above-cited ſays, giving to the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors the power to remit or retain ſins, hath alſo obliged the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Confeſs all the ſins which after a ſufficient Examen they remember. Thus to conceal a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin in Confeſsion, is a formal diſobedience to the Law of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in a matter of the higheſt concern.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this Sin is a formal and poſitive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in a matter of the higheſt conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> The juſtification, and eternal Salvation of the Soul; an untruth not told to Man but to God, whoſe place the Prieſt holds in Confeſsion: Now to tell a lye to God is a ſtrange Crime. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the rigorous puniſhment which God by S. <hi>Peter</hi> laid upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife, for having told an untruth in a thing of leſs importance, where they denied only part of the price of ſome goods they ſold, which they concealed. <hi>You have not,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>lyed to men, but to God. Act.</hi> 5.4. And at theſe words they fell down dead at his feet.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this Sin is not only a diſobedience to the Law of God, and a baſe lye; but alſo a ſin of Sacrilege, and that one of the greateſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Sacrilege is one of the heinouſeſt ſins one can commit; for it is an abuſe and a prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a conſecrated and holy thing, that is to ſay, of a thing dedicated to God, and which partakes of his ſanctity. And as amongſt holy things there are ſome more holy then others, ſo amongſt Sacrileges there are ſome greater and more enormous then others, according to the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:38446:71"/>proportion of the thing that is prophan'd. Now the abuſe and prophanation of the Sacrament of Penance, by him who conceals a Mortal Sin, is not only an abuſe of a holy thing, but of a thing moſt holy. Becauſe the Sacraments are not only exteriourly holy, like Churches, Altars, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Veſſels, which are holy becauſe they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to holy uſes; but they contain holineſs in themſelves, becauſe they cauſe and beſtow it upon men. If then it be a horrible Sacrilege to prophane a Church, overthrow an Altar, abuſe a Chalice, judge what we ought to ſay of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe and prophanation of a Sacrament, and what a horrour we ought to have of ſuch a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſider the evil you do in abuſing this Sacrament in particular, for this Sacrament is inſtituted to appeaſe and pacify our Lord, and to reconcile us unto him. Now in making a falſe Confeſsion, you provoke God to anger, by thoſe very means, which he hath appointed to appeaſe him: you make him your enemy, at the ſame time that you go to make your atonement with him; and you change the Sacrament which is a Judgment or Sentence of Abſolution, into a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Sentence of Condemnation. O how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable are you! are you not in dread of that Curſe of the Prophet? <hi>Woe be to you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that turn judgement into wormwood.</hi> Amos. 5.7.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, conſider the great injury you do to the adorable Blood of the Son of God: for by this Sacrament the merits of that blood are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us for the remiſsion of our Sins; and when the Prieſt pronounces the Sacred words of Abſolution, he pours upon us that pretious
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:38446:72"/>blood, <hi>which waſhes us,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.7. <hi>from the ſpots and ſtains which we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by all our ſins.</hi> But when you are ſo void of grace, as to make a falſe Confeſsion, and having made it, to permit the Prieſt to give you Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you fruſtrate the effect of the blood of the Son of God, which falling upon a Criminal and unworthy Subject, as you then are, is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned, contemned, and violated, then when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhed it upon the Earth, and unworthily trampled it under their feet. Be afraid here of that menace of the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 10.28. where he ſaith: <hi>He that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi> Moyſes <hi>his Law, dieth without mercy:—of how much more ſevere puniſhment, think ye, ſhall he deſerve, who treadeth under foot the Son of God, and eſteemeth the blood of the Teſtament, wherewith he was ſanctified, as an unholy thing, and doth affront the Spirit of grace.</hi> Ponder well upon theſe three injuries: for all theſe you do by a falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, conſider how little reaſon you have to commit ſo great evils in thus concealing your ſins in Confeſsion; this cannot proceed but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>ſhame,</hi> which are the two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Companions of Sin; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>in Apologet. Omne malum aut timore, aut pudore natura ſuffudit.</hi> As for <hi>fear,</hi> what is it that you can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in this occaſion? If you fear to be defamed, conſider that you diſcover your ſins but to one man alone, and ſo this cannot defame you; but beſides, he is obliged to ſecrecy by all both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Laws; and he cannot violate that ſecret but he makes himſelf worthy of death both before God and Man. So that there is no
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:38446:72"/>danger of your honour. Are you afraid to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by your Ghoſtly Father? this is what ſometimes hinders ſimple people; who yet in reality are not ſimple, but blind and ſtupid, to commit ſo dreadfull a ſin for fear of ſo ſmall an evil; and to be more apprehenſive of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a Ghoſtly Father, who doth not do it, but meerly out of Charity and for your good, then you are afraid of the offence of God, and to be reprehended and condemned by him, to be ſcoffed at by the Divels, and loſt for evermore. Has not he loſt his wit who makes ſuch a choice? The ſame is to be ſaid of thoſe, who conceal their ſins for fear of a great Penance, which is yet a more unſupportable ſtupidity and blindneſs; yet this happens ſometimes, and chiefly amongſt young and ignorant people. Let us now come to ſpeak of <hi>ſhame,</hi> which is the ſecond reaſon, why the Penitent conceals his ſins in Confeſsion, as vain as the former.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I agree and acknowledge that Sin deſerves we ſhould be aſhamed of it, and that he is not truly penitent that hath not this ſhame, and that he juſtly merits that reproch which God gave to a Sinner. <hi>Hierem.</hi> 33. <hi>Thou haſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of a diſhoneſt woman, thou wilt not bluſh for thy crimes.</hi> But I maintain, that ſhame ought not to hinder any one from diſcovering all their ſins in Confeſsion; that which with-holds us from ſuch a declaration is not <hi>ſhame,</hi> but a weakneſs of mind, or to ſay better, a <hi>folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Theotime,</hi> can there be a greater folly then not to deſire to cure a great evil by another which is much leſs? then to chuſe rather to damn ones ſoul for ever, then to ſave it by a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:38446:73"/>ſhame or confuſion which laſts but for a moment? What would you ſay of a Criminall, who having deſerved death ſhould refuſe the pardon offer'd him by the King upon this Condition; that he would diſcover his Crime in ſecret to a Judge, appointed by him? would not all cry out, that this man had loſt his Wits? yet this is his caſe, who conceals any thing in Confeſſion. Blind that you are, who chuſe rather to dye and be loſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally then confeſs your ſins to the Judge, whom God hath appointed to take cognizance of them; who will rather hide the wound that will cauſe your death, then ſhew it to the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion who will cure it without fail; who chuſe rather to bluſh one day before God in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Angels, Men, and the whole Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then now to be aſhamed, and bluſh but for one moment before your Ghoſtly Father. When you conceal your Sins from Men, do you think by that means to hide them from the ſight of God? you fear the ſight of Man, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend not at all that God ſhould know them. Is not this to diſeſteem the Divinity, and ſcoff at God.</p>
                  <p>In reality this ſhame is not ſo great a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if we do but make a true Judgment of it. But ſuppoſe it were a thouſand times greater, conſider that it is but a puniſhment for your ſins, and that you have deſerved it, yea, and a far greater confuſion, and an eternal diſgrace: why then will you not ſuffer it?</p>
                  <p>Behold the great advantages it will bring you, the remiſsion of your Sins, the quiet of your Conſcience, the friendſhip of God, and Eternal Salvation. O happy confuſion! It is this of which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38446:73"/>the wiſe man ſpeaks. Eccl. 4.25. <hi>There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion that brings grace and Glory,</hi> as there is <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which brings Sin,</hi> which is that miſchievous ſhame of which we ſpeak in this place.</p>
                  <p>But in fine, conſider one thing to which there is no reply, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is impoſsible you ſhould ever be ſaved without confeſsing that ſin which you are troubled to declare. Perform all the good work you pleaſe of Prayers, Auſterity, or Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, as long as you retain any one mortal Sin in your heart without declaring it in Confeſsion, there is no Salvation for you; and if you dye in that State you are loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>Do not tell me that you will confeſs it ſome day or other hereafter; but for the preſent that you cannot do it. Remember that the longer you defer it, the greater will your ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be, and you will have more trouble to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it.</p>
                  <p>But in expectation of that day, I ask whether in the interim you will go to Confeſsion or no? if you will, then you will commit ſo many ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, as will make you a thouſand times more Criminal in the ſight of God; and which will draw upon your head the divine anger and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. If you do not go to Confeſsion; in what a diſorder and confuſion do you put your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? and to what danger do you expoſe your Salvation? who hath told you that that day, or time will come which you propoſe to your ſelf, and that you ſhall not dye before; and without Confeſsion, being you would not confeſs, when you had both time and means to do it.</p>
                  <p>For Concluſion, my dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> if you be in that miſerable State, I conjure you to look to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:38446:74"/>your ſelf, open your eyes and awake from that Lethargy. Conſider how it is the Devil that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives you, and raiſes in you that wicked ſhame, or that fooliſh fear, by which he would work your eternall Damnation, as he hath done to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of your age, and condition.</p>
                  <p>Call to mind that poor poſſeſſed perſon in the Goſpell whom the Devil had render'd both deaf and dumb. His miſery did in ſuch a manner move the Son of God that he wept. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. <hi>Suspiciens in Caelum ingemuit, &amp; ait Ephpheta quod eſt adaperire, &amp; ſtatim ſolutum eſt vinculum linguae ejus, &amp; loquebatur recte. Raiſing up his eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> ſaith the Goſpell, <hi>he wept, and ſaid, be open, and preſently his tongue was untyed, and he spake plain.</hi> The miſeries, which we conſider in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of that poſſeſs'd man, are found dayly in the Soul, which the Devil hath poſſeſs'd by Sin; only with this difference, that the condition of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is far more dangerous then the firſt. They were the ſpiritual miſeries repreſented in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the deaf and dumb man, which drew tears and ſighs from the Son of God. Take pitty on your ſelf, and render not your ſelf unworthy of the compaſsion he hath for you. Be no longer deaf to the commands he hath given you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your Sins in Confeſsion, nor to all thoſe reaſons which oblige you to it. Courage, make a ſtrong reſolution, and execute it readily, and have a care you be not remiſs. The Son of God will aſsiſt you in it with his grace, he will open your mouth freely to confeſs your Sins, you will receive a thouſand Conſolations from him, and praiſing his holy name you will ſing forth, <hi>bene omnia fecit, &amp; ſurdos fecit audire &amp; mutos loqui. He
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:38446:74"/>hath done all things well, he hath made the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the preparation for Confeſſion, or, Examen of Conſcience.</head>
                  <p>THere is no doubt but we ought to prepare our ſelves for Confeſsion; and being our memory, ordinarily ſpeaking, is not ſo tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to keep in mind things paſt, except we apply our ſelves to call them back; it follows that the ſame authority, which obligeth us to an entire Confeſsion of our ſins, doth oblige us alſo to make before-hand an examen of Conſcience, that ſo we may remember the three things above-mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The Species, the Number, and the moſt notorious Circumſtances. This made the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſay, that one is obliged to declare <hi>all their ſins which they remember after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent examen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certain that no general rule can be preſcribed for this preparation, which doth not depend upon the circumſtances of the Perſon, of his capacity, of time, of neceſsity, and ſuch like: for there is more time required to prepare ones ſelf for an Annual then for a Monthly Confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Thoſe who have an ill memory, or who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not their daily actions, or ſeldom examen their Conſciences, have need of a longer prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then others.</p>
                  <p>We muſt follow herein that moſt judicious method which the Catechiſm of the Council preſcribes: <hi>In confeſſione ſumma illa eura &amp; dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia ad hibenda eſt, quam in rebus graviſsimis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere

That is, to uſe the ſame diligence in this preparation we are wont to employ in affairs of greateſt importance; wherefore as in thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons every one applies himſelf ſeriouſly, and with all his power, and uſeth all imaginable diligence, and endeavours that nothing may be wanting, which is neceſſary to compaſs his deſign; we muſt do the ſame in this of Confeſsion, where we do not treat of any temporal concern, but of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our Eternal Salvation, by gaining the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of our Sins; a remiſsion which cannot be otherwiſe obtained, but by means of a good Confeſsion.</p>
                  <p>To practice well this general rule, we muſt perform theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we muſt pray to Almighty God, and beg of him he will vouchſafe his Divine Light, whereby we may ſee our ſins: this is a means which we muſt never forget, and which we may ſay, is abſolutely neceſſary. The heart of man is ſo ſecret, that he himſelf oftentimes doth not know himſelf, and none but God can ſearch it to the bottom. Our Conſcience is ſometimes ſo darkened, and ſo obſcured, that we are not able to ſee into it, either by means of our memory or knowledge; only God by his grace and inward light, which he communicates to the Soul, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſsipate and diſperſe that darkneſs; which when he doth, we eaſily diſcover many ſpots, which before we did not ſee; as we ſee in the rays of the Sun many things, which, when we had only a leſſer light, were hidden from our eyes. Wherefore, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> in this preparation you muſt never deſiſt,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:38446:76"/>but continually pray to God for this heavenly light. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.29. <hi>Deus meus illumina tenebras meas: O my God clear the darkneſs of my Soul,</hi> that I may diſcover my ſins: Come O Holy Ghoſt, &amp; dart me from heaven a ray of thy divine light.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you muſt obſerve ſome method in ſearching out your ſins, that ſo you may not forget any: the beſt is to run over in order the Commandments, of God and of the Church, with the ſeven Deadly Sins: For being every ſin is a tranſgreſsion of the Law of God, we cannot more eaſily fall into the account of the ſins we have committed, then by running over his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and examining upon every one by it ſelf, whether we have tranſgreſſed againſt it, in what? and how? and being one may offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, not only one, but many ways, it is neceſſary that we know the divers Sins which may be committed againſt each, either to learn them by books which treat thereof, or by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſome underſtanding Perſon: We ſhall ſet down hereafter an exact Examen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to make yet better this examen of your Conſcience, you muſt retire into your ſelf, there to take cognizance of your inclinations; your chief paſsions; the Sins which you moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily fall into; the occaſions you have to offend God; the perſons you converſe with; the places you have frequented; the affairs you have been concern'd; in the particular obligations of your ſtate; the omiſsions you are guilty of, and many other ſuch like things.</p>
                  <p>If you practiſe well theſe three means <hi>Theotime,</hi> you comply with the diligence, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at your hands in this preparation; but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:38446:77"/>practice them with ſerenity and quietneſs of mind, without racking or torturing your Soul; for diſquietneſs and anxiety of mind, are ſo far from being an help, that they are an hindrance to Confeſsion.</p>
                  <p>Remember that God requires nothing from you but what you can perform; perform it then orderly and faithfully, and when you have done, concern not your ſelf any more about your exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but beg pardon of God for your Sins.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the diſtinction which muſt be made between Mortal and Venial Sin.</head>
                  <p>IN this examen of Conſcience we muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employ the memory to remember the Sin, but alſo the judgment to diſcern the quality and grievouſneſs of them; it being certain, that all Sins are not equal, or alike.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, and the moſt ſignal difference, which ought to be obſerved, is that of Mortal and Venial: the knowledge of this diſtinction is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary in this place; becauſe Mortal Sin depriving us of the grace of God, cannot be remitted but by a penitential ſorrow; it requires an entire Confeſsion, a far greater ſorrow and another kind of ſatisfaction then Venial, which doth not deſtroy the grace of God in a Soul, may be forgiven without the Sacrament, and doth not require neceſſarily to be Confeſſed, altho' it be always very good to do it.</p>
                  <p>That you may underſtand this difference right, you muſt know,</p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:38446:77"/>
                  <p>That every Sin is a trangreſsion of the Law of God; but with this difference, that it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heavy, or heinous, and ſometimes light.</p>
                  <p>It is heavy, when it is acted in a matter of concern, with knowledge and conſent.</p>
                  <p>It is light, when it wants either all or any of theſe three conditions: That is, either when the thing it ſelf is light, or being heavy is without ſufficient conſent; or with conſent, but without knowledge of the evil; ſo that it be not an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, wilfull, or voluntary ignorance.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is called Mortal, taking it's name from it's effect; by reaſon of the death it cauſeth in the Soul, by depriving her of the grace of God, which is its Life.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is call'd Venial, becauſe offending God but lightly, it is more pardonable.</p>
                  <p>The heavy Trangreſsion offends God grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, it makes one incurr his diſpleaſure, robs the ſoul of Grace, makes it loſe the right it had to Heaven, which is the inheritance of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and renders it ſubject to Eternal Damnation.</p>
                  <p>The light Tranſgreſsion offending God but ſlightly, doth not make the Soul incurr his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute diſpleaſure, but only it cauſes ſome ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the love, which God hath for her.</p>
                  <p>All that, which the Scripture ſays of the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Sin, is to be underſtood of the firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion, as <hi>Jac.</hi> 1.15. <hi>That it cauſeth death.</hi> Iſa. 59.2. <hi>That it ſets God and man at a diſtauce:</hi> And in a word, all that which we have ſaid above in the Second part. Chap. 10.</p>
                  <p>And that which the Scripture ſays, that <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.16. <hi>The Juſt Man falls ſeven times a day,</hi> that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:38446:78"/>Jac. 3.2. <hi>All of us offend God many ways,</hi> that 1. Jo. 18. <hi>If we ſay we have no Sin we deceive our ſelves,</hi> Is all to be underſtood of the Second.</p>
                  <p>As theſe two ſorts of ſins are much different as well in their weight or enormity, as effect; ſo alſo are they very unlike in their remiſſion: for Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſin cannot be pardoned, but by the Sacrament of Penance, or perfect <hi>Contrition</hi> out of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but always with relation to the Sacrament, and an obligation to receive it: whereas veniall ſin may be remitted by the only remorſe for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed it, accompanied with a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of amendment.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon in Confeſsion we muſt take great notice of the Sins which are Mortal, or which we believe to be ſo, that we may Confeſs them exactly and entirely, without concealing any, deplore them in the ſight of God, and do the Penance they ſhall deſerve.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Confeſſion of Venial Sins.</head>
                  <p>AS for Venial Sins, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath given us two rules to follow.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that to obtain the remiſsion of them, it is not abſolutely neceſſary to Confeſs them, and they may be forgiven by only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and a ſorrow for having committed them. The reaſon which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> gives, is, becauſe Venial Sins do not at all deſtroy Sanctifying grace: and ſo it is not neceſſary they ſhould come under the Juriſdiction of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:38446:78"/>of Pennance, which is Inſtituted to reſtore that Grace to thoſe who have loſt it.</p>
                  <p>The Second rule is, that although there be no neceſſity, yet it is very profitable and wholſome to Confeſs the Venial Sins, for many reaſons. 1. Becauſe by the Sacrament of Penance they are pardon'd both with more certainty, and more Grace. 2ly, By confeſſing them one learns bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to know, and correct them. 3ly, It is a very profitable means to avoid Mortal Sin, as well by reaſon of the Grace which one receives by the Sacrament, as alſo becauſe he that hath a care to cleanſe his Soul from leſſer Sins, will be more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous and apprehenſive how he falls into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to that ſentence of our Lord, <hi>in modico fidelis in majore fidelis erit. Luc.</hi> 16.10.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two things which are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Confeſſion of Venial Sins.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is therein to avoid Scruples and diſquiet or anxiety of mind; an errour which many commit, who examen themſelves of their veniall Sins with the ſame trouble or concern, as if they were Mortal, and ſpend ſo much time in that examination, that they think little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the means how to amend them.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing to be obſerved is, that when they confeſs veniall Sins, they always conceive a ſorrow for having committed them, and make a Reſolution to amend them. Without theſe two acts, it is to no purpoſe to confeſs them; they are not forgiven, although they receive Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their other Sins, whereof they had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and I tell you more, that if it happen that one have no other but Veniall Sins to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:38446:79"/>and have not ſorrow or remorſe for any of them, the Abſolution would be null; and ſuch a perſon would commit a Sacrilege, by reaſon the Sacrament would want one of its eſſential parts, which is Contrition. This is a thing we muſt have a great care of, for it may happen very eaſily.</p>
                  <p>But when I ſay we muſt reſolve, or have a will to amend our Venial Sins, I ſpeak of a real and ſincere will, which may be effectuall, and not of a perpetual relapſe, as it frequently falls out.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay that this is very hard, and that it is impoſſible to be without Venial Sins. To this I Anſwer, and it imports you to obſerve it well, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are three ſorts of venial Sins, ſome which proceed from weakneſs, others that are committed by inadvertency and ſurprize, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which we call Sins of Malice, that is, which ſpring from our ſole will with a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Such are thoſe which are committed on ſet purpoſe, or by an affected negligence: which one will not at all amend, or which happen by ſome tye or irregular affection which he hath to any thing.</p>
                  <p>As to the Sins of weakneſs, or ſurprize, it is true, we can never be totally exempt from them; and for theſe it ſufficeth to have a good will to amend as well as one can.</p>
                  <p>But as for Sins which proceed from our will, it is in our power to amend, and we are ſtrictly obliged to it, becauſe they very much diſpleaſe God, and the conſequences are extreamly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sins, <hi>Theotime,</hi> although they ſeem light, produce very ill effects. They are light if they be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:38446:79"/>conſidered each one by themſelves, but being neglected and multiplyed, they become very dangerous. They do not deſtroy Sanctifying Grace; but they diſpoſe us very much to loſe it. All together they do not make a Mortal Sin; but they diſpoſe the Soul to fall into it. They do not directly cauſe Death; but they cauſe weakneſs and maladies which bring Death along with them, that is, which make us fall into Mortal Sin. In a word, although theſe Sins do not break the league and amity betwixt God and the Soul, which is in Grace, yet by little and little, they diminiſh it, and by this diminution Charity is weakened in us, and God alſo by degrees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the graces and aſſiſtances which he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes us in all our Spiritual neceſſities: And thus having leſs ſtrength we more eaſily fall into Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin, when Temptation comes. Alas, <hi>Theotime,</hi> how many are there, who have, and dayly do lamentably fall, the firſt ſource whereof was their neglect in correcting venial Sins.</p>
                  <p>Take great care of this reſolution to amend them; whether it be, that you are in the State of Grace, that you may conſerve it, by avoiding theſe ſorts of Sin; or you are not, leſt you make your ſelf more unworthy by your neglect of them.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of Interiour and Exteriour Sins, or of the Sins of Thought and Action.</head>
                  <p>IT is alſo very neceſſary, and to be obſerved in Confeſſion &amp; examination of Sins, to know that there are Sins that may be committed interiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by a voluntary or willing thought only, and others which proceed even to the exteriour action. Thus to take Pleaſure in a thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge or to deſire it, is an interiour Sin, or a Sin of thought; actually to put in execution the ſame revenge, is an exteriour Sin, or a Sin of action.</p>
                  <p>It happens frequently that Penitents who are not well inſtructed, confeſs exteriour Sins, when they have committed them, but ſay nothing of interiour Sins and thoſe of thought, when they have not proceeded unto action or effect.</p>
                  <p>However it is moſt certain, that interiour Sins are the firſt Sins, and very Criminal in the ſight of God; and even exteriour Sins are not Sins, but becauſe they proceed from the heart, that is from the will, which is the ſource of the Good and Evil which we do. It is that which cauſeth all the Evil which is in our Actions; and they are not wicked, but in as much as they are order'd and conſented to by the will.</p>
                  <p>This was the reaſon why our Saviour ſaid, that the heart is the Fountain of all our Sins. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.18. <hi>From the Heart</hi> (ſays he) <hi>come Adultery, Fornications, Evil Thoughts.</hi> And the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.18. that <hi>God hath in Abomination the Heart
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:38446:80"/>that contrives evil thoughts.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 1.3. that <hi>Wicked thoughts ſeperate us from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt have a care then, <hi>Theotime,</hi> when you Confeſs, to accuſe your ſelf of the Sins of Thought, when you have committed them; altho' you have not put them in execution; nay even when afterward you have retracted them in your heart, for this retractation does not hinder the evil from having been conſented to in thought; and altho' it would have been far greater if you had actually put it in Execution, yet however to have only deſired it ceaſeth not to be very heinous.</p>
                  <p>Now I would have you obſerve that there are three degrees in theſe Sins of thought: The firſt is Complacence, the ſecond Deſire, and the Third the Reſolution.</p>
                  <p>Complacence in an evil thought is a Mortall Sin, if it be voluntary or or with a willing mind, and if the thing one thinks on be in it ſelf a Mortall Sin; as an impure Action, a Notorious Revenge, or the like.</p>
                  <p>The Deſire, which frequently follows the Complacence, is alſo a Mortal Sin in the two Circumſtances above-mention'd, when it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away voluntarily to an evil thing; and we ſee it is forbidden by the two laſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the law of God. Now if you would know what is meant by a deſire; <hi>Deſire is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional will, or a will to do the evil if it lay in our power, and if we had an occaſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reſolution to do the evil is alſo a Mortall Sin, and greater then the other two, and muſt be confeſſed altho' it were not put in Execution,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:38446:81"/>and even altho' he have retracted and changed his reſolution, as we ſaid before.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Sin of Action, and of Omiſſion.</head>
                  <p>THis difference of Sins is alſo very neceſſary to be known, as well for Confeſſion, as for the Conduct of a Chriſtian Life.</p>
                  <p>Sins that conſiſt in Action are eaſily known, confeſs'd, and avoided; but Sins of Omiſſion are hardly underſtood, ſeldom Confeſſed, and ſcarcely avoided; being it is hard to know when one is wanting to this obligation.</p>
                  <p>Yet this Sin is often as great as that of action: and a man ſhall be Damned for not doing that which he is obliged to do, as ſoon as he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the evil which is forbidden him.</p>
                  <p>For the Law of God, <hi>Theotime,</hi> whereof Sin is a tranſgreſſion, doth not only forbid evil, but alſo commands good. There are ſome of theſe precepts which are negative, and forbid evil; as thoſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill, Thou ſhalt not Steal;</hi> and others are conceived in poſitive terms, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſome good; as thoſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, Keep holy the Sabboth day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Each Commandment in reality is both poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and negative: for thoſe which command a good, forbid the oppoſit evil, and thoſe that prohibit an evil, command the contrary good. For example, the precept which commands us to love God, forbids us to do any thing that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes him: And the Commandment that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:38446:81"/>us from robbing, obligeth us to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the goods, to him whom we had robbed: and thus of others. And there is never a Commandment againſt which one may not Sin both by Commiſſion, and Omiſſion.</p>
                  <p>This being ſo, it is of great concern when one is to go to Confeſſion, that he examen himſelf of the Sins of Omiſſion, as well as thoſe of Action, and that he accuſe himſelf not only of evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he hath done, but alſo of the good works he has not done, when he was obliged.</p>
                  <p>In the examen which we ſhall give you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, we ſhall put the Sins of Omiſſion together with the others upon every one of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>
                  <p>But chiefly we muſt examen carefully theſe Sins of Omiſſion, when we ſearch into the Sins which belong particularly to our ſtate: For each ſtate and condition hath peculiar obligations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which one Sins very frequently, by noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Omiſſions, which are very great Sins, and which are not always obſerved, as they ſhould be, by thoſe who often fall into them. From hence it is that we do not amend them, and that at the hour of Death we find our ſelves far more charged with Sins, then ever we imagined during our life.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Sins of Ignorance, Paſſion, and Malice.</head>
                  <p>I add here alſo this diſtinction, or theſe ſeveral branches of Sins, becauſe they conduce very much toward the making us underſtand the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them, and how to form a better judgment of their enormity.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction ſprings from the Nature of Sin, which is a <hi>voluntary,</hi> and <hi>free</hi> action: As it is <hi>voluntary</hi> it muſt be perform'd <hi>knowingly:</hi> as it is <hi>free</hi> it muſt be done in ſuch a manner, <hi>that the will might not have done it.</hi> Knowledge is hindred by Ignorance; <hi>the power not to do it,</hi> is hindred by Paſſions, which carry the will on to do evil, or withdraw it from good: I ſay hindred, that is, either diminiſhed, or totally taken away. When Knowledge is wanting, it is a Sin of Ignorance; when the power not to do it is hindred by Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is a Sin of Paſſion; but when we are free both from the one and the other, Paſſion as well as Ignorance, then it is a Sin which proceeds from the will alone, and is called a Sin of Malice, that is, of the will acting with full knowledge, and of her own accord, without being puſh'd on or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by any Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>It imports you much that you ſhould be well inſtructed in this Point, <hi>Theotime,</hi> becauſe the greateſt part of the world excuſe their Sins ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon account of their ignorance, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is but too ordinary amongſt young people. It is true there is ſometimes ignorance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:38446:82"/>or paſſion found in their Sins: but they muſt not excuſe themſelves for that: for I ſhall make it out, that neither Ignorance nor Paſſion do all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diminiſh them; and that the greateſt part of their Sins are Sins of Malice. And for the greater facility we ſhall divide this Chapter into Articles.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="article">
                     <head>
                        <hi>ARTICLE I.</hi> Of the Sins of Ignorance.</head>
                     <p>IT is call'd a Sin of ignorance, which one hath committed for want of ſufficient knowledge either of the action that he hath done, or of the evil which there is in ſuch an action.</p>
                     <p>Ignorance of the action is called ignorance of the Fact. Ignorance of the evil which is in the action, is called ignorance of the Law; of which we may be ignorant two ways, either totally, or in part: Totally, when we believe there is no ill in the action; in part, when we believe, indeed there is ſome, but not ſo much evil in it, as in effect there is. Either of theſe ignorances may happen two ways, either by our fault and our will, or without any fault or will on our ſide.</p>
                     <p>It happens by our fault, when we are willing to be ignorant of a thing, whether expreſsly and on ſet purpoſe, or implicitly by a certain affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed negligence, willfully neglecting to learn what we do not know.</p>
                     <p>It happens without any fault of ours, when there is neither an expreſs will, nor any notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous negligence on our part, and it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:38446:83"/>to us to know it, or to be inſtructed in it.</p>
                     <p>This being ſuppoſed, it is eaſy to tell when it is, that ignorance diminiſheth the Sin; when that it takes it away totally; and when not at all.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, when ignorance doth not proceed at all from our fault neither directly, nor indirectly, it is certain it takes away the Sin totally, and that the action which we do is not a Sin; the reaſon is becauſe there is no Sin without a will, and there is no will where there is no knowledge. Thus when <hi>Noe</hi> by drinking Wine at firſt was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, his exceſs in drink was not a Sin, becauſe he knew not then the force of wine, nor could know it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when ignorance proceeds from our fault by an expreſs will, or groſſe and affected ignorance, it neither takes away, nor diminiſhes at all the Sin; on the contrary it rather augments it. The reaſon is, becauſe he that deſires the cauſe deſires alſo the effect. If then I deſire to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the evil that is in an action, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by that ignorance that I Sin more freely, and without remorſe; I am the voluntary cauſe of the Sin whoſe enormity I would not know. Such was the ignorance of the unchaſt old men in the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 13.9. <hi>That they caſt down their Eyes, that they might not ſee Heaven, nor remember the Judgments of God.</hi> Such is the ignorance of thoſe that will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in what they ought to know, nor adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of the evil they do, and who will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to do well. As the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.4. This is what frequently happens to young People.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, as the total ignorance of any evil in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38446:83"/>an action, taketh away all the Sin, when it doth not proceed from our fault; ſo the ignorance of the part of the evil in which is a Sin, takes away part, that is, diminiſheth the Sin: This is to be underſtood of that ignorance which doth not proceed from our fault, nor is it in our power to be better inſtructed. Such is the ignorance of young People when they begin to fall into Sins of impurity, for they know well enough that there is ill in it, which appears by the doubts they have in their Conſcience, and by the ſhame they have to Confeſs: But they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the ill is ſo great as in reality it is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as they are inſtructed, and till then their Sins are not ſo great, altho' they be almoſt always Mortal Sins.</p>

                     <p>THe Sins of frailty are thoſe which proceed from the will moved with ſome paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Paſſions are actions of the ſenſitive Appetite, which is an inferiour part of the Soul, and moves towards things forbidden by the law of God; ſuch as are Love, Hatred, Sadneſs, Fear, Anger.</p>
                     <p>Some puſh on the Soul to do that which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it, as Love, Hatred, Joy, Choler: others withdraw it from doing the good which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as Fear, Sadneſs, Deſpair: Thoſe cauſe the Sins of Action, Theſe the Sins of Omiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Paſſions diminiſh the liberty of the will, becauſe being puſh'd on, or withdrawn by other cauſes
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38446:84"/>then by her ſelf, ſhe doth not act with all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſhe hath in that action, either to do, or not do what ſhe will. Beſides, theſe Paſſions dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh alſo the judgment hindring the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which guides the will, from judging of things ſo clearly, as otherwiſe it would.</p>
                     <p>They diminiſh by conſequence the Sin, which is found in an action, or omiſſion, and this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently: ſometimes leſs, ſometimes more, and ſometimes totally, and othertimes they diminiſh them not at all, but rather augment them.</p>
                     <p>They diminiſh ſometimes but little, when they are but light, and the will may eaſily overcome them.</p>
                     <p>They diminiſh the Sin much, when they are ſtrong and violent; becauſe for that time they notoriouſly diminiſh the judgment and liberty; however as long as they leave man with the knowledge of the evil which he does, the Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſtill.</p>
                     <p>They totally take away the Sin, when they are ſo violent, that they totally cloud the reaſon, ſo that one doth not perceive at all that there is a Sin; which never happens, but in the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of paſſion; which being a little appeas'd, the mind returns to it ſelf, and knows what it has done, and from thenceforward he Sins if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in his Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>In fine, Paſſions do not at all diminiſh the Sin when they are voluntary; and this happens when they are willingly excited, or when one enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them, and endeavours to augment them, as it happens too often; and in this caſe they are not Sins of Paſſion, but of malice.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICE III.</hi> Of Sins of Malice.</head>
                     <p>BY Sins of Malice we do not underſtand here, Sins which are maliciouſly committed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purely to diſpleaſe God, or for the ſole plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which one takes in doing ill: Theſe Sins are rather Sins of Devils, then men, and thoſe who are ſo unfortunate, as to Sin thus, begin in this world to live the life of Devils, which God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten puniſheth alſo with the puniſhment of Devils, which is Obſtinacy and Impenitence. Theſe are the Sins which our Saviour calls <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Sins againſt the holy Ghoſt</hi> which are <hi>neither forgiven in this world nor the next.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sins of Malice, whereof I ſpeak in this place, are thoſe, which are committed without Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and without Paſſion, that is with full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and entire liberty; and they are called Sins of Malice, becauſe being commited neither out of ignorance nor paſſion, they proceed only from the ill inclination of the will, which ſcruples not to offend God, upon condition it may compaſs the enjoyment of its Pleaſures or other ſenſible content, which it ſeeks by Sin.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Sins are very great, and highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing in the ſight of God, being they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to excuſe them, as the two former had. Theſe muſt be Confeſſed very exactly, declaring fully this circumſtance, that they committed them knowing well what they did, and on ſet purpoſe; and it is neceſſary that they do great pennance for them.</p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:38446:85"/>
                     <p>As theſe Sins are great, ſo they ought to be rare and unheard of amongſt Chriſtians; but it happens by a ſad misfortune that there is nothing more common. And if the lives of men were well examined, the greateſt part of Sins would be found to be Sins of Malice.</p>
                     <p>For as concerning Ignorance, tho' much of it is found amongſt the ordinary Sins of men, and for that reaſon it is ſaid, that every man that Sins is ignorant: How often doth it happen that the ignorance with which they Sin is affected and voluntary? one ſearches after it expreſsly and with deſign; he will be ignorant of that which he is obliged too know; he will not be inſtructed; he fears to look too narrowly into his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and he obliged to the good by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he ſhall have of it. To do thus, is it not to deſire the Sin upon ſet purpoſe and out of malice? for this reaſon they fly all thoſe things that may inſtruct them, as reading of Books, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or amongſt Preachers they care not for thoſe that reprehend vice, or diſcover the ableſt Ghoſtly Father; They ſeek the leſs underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moſt indulgent; They do not conſult at all about the doubts of Conſcience, or if they do, they diſcover not all, they ſeek after favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions to indulge themſelves in remiſs &amp; falſe opinions, they frame a Conſcience to Sin with more liberty. What is this but wilfully to run into a precipice, and ſhut their eyes, that they may caſt themſelves headlong more freely, and without fear?</p>
                     <p>As for Paſſions, we muſt ſay the ſame of them, as of Ignorance: It is true they diminiſh Sin, when they are not voluntary; but when one
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:38446:85"/>ſeeks them on deſign, or is pleaſed to cheriſh or increaſe them, theſe are not Sins of Paſſion; but of Malice: Now how ordinary is this amongſt men? He that has a deſire of revenge, does he not endeavour to nouriſh his hatred and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt his enemy? He ſpeaks againſt him on all occaſions, and is raviſhed with delight to hear one ſpeak againſt him.</p>
                     <p>He whoſe heart is poſſeſt with impure love does all he can to cheriſh it; he applies his care and thoughts that way; all his Senſes are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd therein, as his Eyes, Ears, Tongue, Touch; he loſes no occaſion, he ſearcheth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them with much care and ſollicitude; he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows all the motions of his Paſſion without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or any the leaſt conſtraint upon himſelf. What is this but to Sin on ſet purpoſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice? And thus running over the greateſt part of the Sins of men, we ſhall find that they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ſpring from the will, and men are vicious becauſe they will, or have a mind to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon, <hi>Theotime,</hi> do not uſe to flatter your ſelf in your. Sins, becauſe you are young; do not excuſe your ſelf with the ignorance of your youth, nor with the paſſions which puſh it on: remember that often and often again you make your ignorance and paſſion voluntary or wilfull; and that your Sins proceed from the inclination you have to ill, which you will not correct, and thus the greateſt part of your Sins are Sins of Malice.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICLE IV.</hi> Of Sins which ſpring from a Vicious Habit.</head>
                     <p>I Add here this fourth Article, foraſmuch as next to ignorance and paſſion, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe which draws the will to Sin, and ſeems to diminiſh it; <hi>viz.</hi> A vitious habit; that is, an inclination or facility to fall into a Sin, which facility is contracted by often repeated actions of the ſame Sin; for it is the property of actions to produce ſutable habits.</p>
                     <p>When this habit is ſtrong and inveterate, it cauſes one to fall into Sin without ignorance and without paſſion; witneſs thoſe, who Swear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, who have their mind always full of evil thoughts, who have nothing in their mouth, but immodeſt words, and ſo of others.</p>
                     <p>This inclination is ſometimes ſo great, that it draws after it a kind of neceſſity to fall into the evil: as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays in his Confeſſions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring the unfortunate experience he had of it. <hi>Ex voluntate perverſâ facta eſt libido, &amp; dum ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitur libidini, facta eſt conſuetùdo, &amp; dum conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini non reſiſtitur, facta eſt neceſſitas.</hi> S. Aug. l. 8. Confeſ. c. 5. <hi>The will,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that is once depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, begets an inclination to ill: the inclination produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a habit; a habit when not reſiſted brings a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> Yet this neceſſity doth not take away the ſin, becauſe it doth not take away the liberty of the will, which is always Miſtreſs of her habit; and which by means of grace may overcome it. If you ask, whether a vitious habit diminiſh the Sin?</p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:38446:86"/>
                     <p>I anſwer, that of it ſelf it doth not diminiſh it at all, becauſe it was freely contracted by the will, and it is in her power to overcome it.</p>
                     <p>Hence to judge whether a vicious habit dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Sin, we muſt conſider how the will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves her ſelf in reſpect of the habit, that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe be diſpleas'd, whether ſhe be afflicted, whether ſhe make any endeavours to correct her ſelf, and be delivered of it. For in this caſe the habit without doubt leſſens the Sin, and when one falls therein, he is more excuſable in the ſight of God; and if the Sin be Mortal, it is leſs grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous then if it were committed without a habit.</p>
                     <p>But if he who hath contracted a vicious habit doth not ſtrive to amend; his Sins are nothing leſs for being committed by a habit, and then they are no more ſins of frailty, but become ſins of malice; becauſe he willingly nouriſheth the cauſe that produceth them. And being he doth not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly deſire to correct his vicious habit, he is rationally ſuppoſed to conſent to all the Sins, that ſpring from thence.</p>
                     <p>Take good notice of this rule, <hi>Theotime,</hi> that you may be able to judge aright of the quality of the Sins which you commit by habit, and do not eaſily excuſe your ſelf upon this account; They frequently proceed from your own fault and will.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Sins that are committed by Error, or by Doubt.</head>
                  <p>THeſe alſo are two other Fountains of Sin, which are neceſſary to be known and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined by reaſon of the great number of Sins, that ſpring from them.</p>
                  <p>We call it error in this place, when one believes there is a Sin in the action or omiſſion, when in reality there is none, or that it is a Mortal, when it is but a venial Sin.</p>
                  <p>I Enquire, whether an action or omiſſion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this errour is a Sin? without doubt it is, and ought to be confeſſed, and one ought to have a diligent care of himſelf for the future, in regard to the like occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is becauſe Sin conſiſts in the Will, and the will acts not but as it is guided by the judgment. When the judgment propoſes a thing as ill, whether it be an action or omiſſion, if the Will embraces it, ſhe conſents to it as bad, in as much as ſhe knows no other quality; and Sins, as if the thing were evil in effect; becauſe the ſin doth not conſiſt in the effect, but in the affection. And this is the reaſon why we ſay that an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Conſcience obliges, that is, when one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that it is ill to do, or omit, an action, he is obliged to follow that belief, although falſe, till ſuch time as he ſhall be informed of the truth.</p>
                  <p>You muſt mark this well, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> for two reaſons. Firſt, that you may avoid ſinning
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:38446:87"/>thus by errour, which happens but too often to young people, who believe frequently that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or omiſſions are ſins, when they are not; yet nevertheleſs commit them; and you ought firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hold and follow this rule, never to perform an action, or omiſſion, which you believe to be a Sin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that you may apply this truth to your Confeſſion, in which you ought to examin the Sins you have committed in this errour, and to judg of the ſins you have committed, whether action, or omiſsion: do not only examin whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were a Mortal ſin in it ſelf or no? but whether you did not verily believe it was a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin? for then it muſt be Confeſied, as if it were a Mortal ſin.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you will draw from hence a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in your favour. If then, you will ſay, I judg either an action or omiſsion to be lawfull and exempt from ſin, altho' in effect it be not, it follows, that I ſhall not ſin at all in committing it.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that this is ſometimes true, when this erroneous judgment proceeds from an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ignorance, or where there was no ſault at all of ours, or that it was not in our power to be inſtructed in the contrary: But if this errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from a culpable ignorance, and becauſe we would not be better informed, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens; in this caſe it doth not at all excuſe the ſin; as 'tis above ſaid.</p>
                  <p>As concerning doubt, this alſo is very often the cauſe of ſin, and it concerns us to know it: We call that a doubt, when one is uncertain whether an action, or omiſſion be a ſin or no. This doubt is either very great, or ſmall, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38446:88"/>both: it is very great, when it inclines the judgment to determine that it is a Sin: light, when it rather reſolves that it is not: mean or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both, when it hangs in ſuſpence, and we know not on which ſide to incline the ballance: Hence it is eaſy to tell when a doubt cauſes a Sin, and when not.</p>
                  <p>A very ſtrong doubt makes an action, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion a ſin; becauſe it is eſteemed, as much as a judgment.</p>
                  <p>A light doubt doth not make a thing to be a ſin, in as much as it doth not at all deſtroy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary credence by which one believes there is no ſin in it.</p>
                  <p>As for the doubt which is in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two, and which leaves the judgment in a totall uncertainty neither being able to affirm nor deny, it is ſo far from excuſing from ſin, that he, who in this doubt reſolves to do an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or omiſsion, which he doubts whether it be a Mortall ſin or no, ſins Mortally: The reaſon is, becauſe acting in that formall doubt he is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deſire it ſuch as it might be in it ſelf, and as it might be evill, he was reſolved to do it in caſe it were ſo. This deſerves to be carefully remembered.</p>

                  <p>WE are not only guilty of thoſe ſins which we commit by our ſelves, but alſo of thoſe which we commit by others, that is, of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:38446:88"/>ſins which others commit through our fault.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sins are often very heinous and of great conſequence. Theſe are thoſe of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks when he ſays <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.13. <hi>Cleanſe me O Lord from my hidden Sins, and pardon thy Servant from thoſe which I commit in others.</hi> Yet there is nothing more common amongſt men, nor of which they take leſs care, for want of ſufficient knowledge, or underſtanding of the different ways by which one may concur to anothers Sin. Wherefore I ſhall here treat of them breifly.</p>
                  <p>To ſin by another, is to be the voluntary and culpable cauſe of the Sin, which another commits. I ſay voluntary and culpable; becauſe if we are the cauſe of the ſin of another, without our fault, we do not Sin,</p>
                  <p>Now we may be the cauſe of the ſin of another two ways, poſitively, and negatively; by action or by omiſsion. By action, when we do or ſay ſomething, which induceth our neighbour to ſin. By omiſsion, when we are wanting to ſay or do ſomething, that might hinder our neighbour from offending God.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid when we do or ſay, to denote two ways, whereby we may cauſe ſin in another poſitively. <hi>viz.</hi> by our actions, and by our words. By our actions, which give ill example to our neighbour, or an occaſion to offend God. By words, which induce others to evil.</p>
                  <p>The firſt way is called the ſin of ſcandall, the ſecond inducement to evil. The firſt happens as often as we do any action, which is either wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or eſteemed ſo, which we know or ought to know, that it will be the cauſe that our neighbour will offend God.</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:38446:89"/>
                  <p>The ſecond happens different ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by Teaching, Commanding, Concealing, and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing to Sin by Entreaties, Threats, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The One and the Other of theſe ways are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common amongſt men, and probably are the cauſe of the greateſt part of thoſe ſins, which are dayly committed. The Son of God ſaith <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Vae mundo a Scandalis; neceſſe eſt enim ut veniant Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale; Veruntamen vae homini illi per quem Scandalum venit, &amp;c.</hi> That it is a great misfortune, that the world ſhould be ſo filled with ſcandalls, as it is, and that this cannot otherwiſe be then a moſt lamentable caſe for him who cauſeth the ſcandall, and that <hi>it were better for a man to have a Millſtone tyed to his neck and caſt into the bottom of the Sea then to give Scandall</hi> unto his neighbour, that is, then to make him fall into ſin.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this way of poſitively contributing to the ſin of another by actions, or words, there is another, which we may call negative; which happens when any one refrains from doing or ſaying ſomething, which might hinder our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from offending God. For not to hinder one from ſinning, when we may, is to be the cauſe of the Sin of another. This happens in many caſes, of which we ſhall diſcourſe hereafter at the end of the examen of Sins.</p>

                  <p>IT is the third part of Penance, which conſiſts in doing or ſuffering ſomething to repair in ſome manner the offence or injury, which is done to God by Sin.</p>
                  <p>I ſay to repair in ſome manner, becauſe the great reparation for Sin was performed by the Son of God; who by his Precious Blood and Death, hath exactly repaired the injury which Sin did to God, and merited a generall Pardon of all the puniſhment, which the Divine Juſtice could require.</p>
                  <p>This reparation hath opened and facilitated a way to a reconciliation with God after Sin. For as much as the merits of our Saviour being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to us, as they are, by the Sacraments of Baptiſm and Penance, reſtore us again to the Grace of God, which we had loſt, and make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the remiſsion of the eternall Puniſhment due to our Sins: All this through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and by the vertue of the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he hath given to God the Father for the ſame Sins.

                  <p>But as it is in his power, who receives him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into his favour, by whom he hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, to admit him on ſuch conditions as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall think ſit; and either to remit him all the puniſhment, or to oblige him to undergo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of it; it hath pleaſed the Divine wiſdom in reſpect of us to make uſe of both the one and the other of theſe two ways of reconciliation; tho' more ordinarily of the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>For in Baptiſm he receives us into his Grace, and remits us all the Puniſhment due to our Sins. But in Penance he remits us indeed the Eternall puniſhment, but ſtill reſerves ſome Temporall pains to be impoſed upon the Penitent, to the end he, the Penitent, may ſatisfy on his part according to his power, and for other reaſons, which we ſhall ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>In the undertaking of this Temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſts the ſatisfaction whereof we ſpeak in this place, which is the third part of Penance.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That God pardoning the Sin obliges to a temporal Puniſhment.</head>
                  <p>THis is a fundamental truth in the matter of ſatisfaction, and it is very neceſſary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it well, that we may know what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or a Penance, is, and how much it imports us to comply with it.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid above that God ordinarily makes uſe of the ſecond ſort of reconciliation, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38446:90"/>an obligation at leaſt to ſuffer ſome pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſin: which is eaſy to be proved.</p>
                  <p>He hath always practiced this in the Old Teſtament; Nay even from the beginning of the World.</p>
                  <p>When he pardoned the firſt man his ſin, it was upon condition to do Penance by labour, to which he condemned him; and in effect it was a very ſevere Penance, which continued all his Life.</p>
                  <p>When he pardoned <hi>David</hi> his ſins of Adultery and Murther, he told him by his Prophet, that he ſhould be chaſtiſed by the death of his Child; and he remitted him nothing of all the menaces with which he threatned him by the ſame Prophet; That he himſelf ſhould ſee the diſhonour of his houſe: the diſſention amongſt his Children, and other misfortunes which were foretold him, and all which came to paſs.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon the Penitents of the Old Teſtament, when they begged of God pardon of their ſins, they never as much as ask'd to be exempt from all puniſhment, but only not to be chaſtiſed according to the rigour of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice; they deſired to avoid his fury, and the more fignal effects of his wrath, but they ſubmitted themſelves to the fatherly correction he ſhould be pleaſed to impoſe upon them. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend me not O Lord</hi> ſaid David Pſal. 27. <hi>in thy Fury, nor puniſh me in thy Wrath.</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he declares that he is ready to do Penance and to ſuffer for his Sins, <hi>ibid. v.</hi> 18. <hi>Ecce ego in flagella paratus Sum;</hi> I am prepared ſaith he for Scourges. Another begs of God that he will <hi>Chaſtiſe</hi> him, <hi>but not in his Fury. Corripe me Domine, veruntamen
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:38446:91"/>in judicio non in furore.</hi> Hierem, 10.24.</p>
                  <p>There are a vaſt number of the like examples in the old Teſtament, which ſhew evidently that God doth not pardon Sins, but with an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do Penance; and that the Penitents of that time never pretended, nor required to be exempt from ſuffering for their Sins.</p>
                  <p>Yea even there have been ſome of the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated amongſt them, who have ſounded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depth of the puniſhment, which God hath reſerved to himſelf in the other Life, and who knew that God puniſhed after death the Sins of the juſt, which had not been ſufficiently expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted during Life. So <hi>Judas Machabeus,</hi> not only a great Captain, but alſo high Prieſt of the Law, after a ſignal Victory ſent orders to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to offer Sacrifice for the ſins of the faithfull, who had been ſlain in that fight. And the Scripture 2. <hi>Mach.</hi> 12.46. approves that action, as <hi>an holy and wholſome thought;</hi> aſſuring us that by prayers and Sacrifices the dead are releaſed from their Sins. But this cannot be underſtood of Sin, as to the fault, or the eternall puniſhment, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be remitted after Death, no more then the fault from whence it ſprings. It muſt then be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Temporall puniſhment which the dead ought to ſatisfy for in the other Life, and from which they may be releaſed by the Prayers and Sacrifices of the Living.</p>
                  <p>As to the new Law, here alſo God hath ſtill continued the ſame manner of receiving Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans into his Grace, in obliging them to ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by temporal puniſhment; and that with ſo much more reaſon, as the Law they profeſs is more holy and more perfect.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:38446:91"/>
                  <p>This is the Reaſon why our Saviour hath ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.35. that <hi>at the day of Judgment we muſt give account of the leaſt Sins,</hi> as <hi>idle words:</hi> This ſentence ſhall be given after death: There we ſhall give an account of our ſins, there to receive the puniſhment: This ſhall not at all be an eternall puniſhment, for they will not at all deſerve it; it muſt then be a temporall puniſhment, which muſt be undergone, and by which we muſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy in the other Life, if we have not ſatisfyed during this.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo it is that the ſame Son of God by giving to his Apoſtles power to remit and retain ſins, hath alſo given that of binding and looſing Sinners. This power of binding reacheth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things: but amongſt others it contains the Power of obliging Penitents to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their ſins; and in releaſing them from the bonds of the guilt and eternall puniſhment, it impoſes upon them a temporall pain, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Divine Juſtice. Thus the Church hath always urderſtood that power of binding, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath declared <hi>Seſ</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 8. adding <hi>Can.</hi> 15. an <hi>Anathema</hi> to thoſe that hold the contrary.</p>
                  <p>This is the cauſe, why the ſame Church which is infallible in the interpretation of the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her Spouſe, hath always made uſe of this power from the Apoſtles even unto this preſent time, having always received Sinners unto the Sacrament of Penance, by impoſing upon them wholſome penances for their ſins. For which ſhe her ſelf hath made rules and Canons, preſcribing different penances for different ſorts of Sins.</p>

                  <p>THe holy Council of <hi>Trent</hi> treating of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, brings ſo efficacious and moving rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to evince this truth, that to omit them here, <hi>Theotime,</hi> would be to deprive you of a ſignal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                  <p>It draws the firſt from the great equity of the Divine Juſtice, which treats thoſe in a different manner who are differently or unequally guilty; as thoſe are who have ſinned before Baptiſme, and thoſe, who have offended after they have received it. For as concerning the former, as they have ſinned with more ignorance, and without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received ſo many graces as Chriſtians have, God remits them by Baptiſme not only all their Sins, but alſo all the puniſhment which he might juſtly exact in ſatisfaction for them; granting them an abſolute and entire pardon or an act of oblivion and indemnity of all that is paſſed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their entrance into Chriſtian Religion. But he treats otherwiſe with them who relapſe into ſin after Baptiſme, whoſe faults are infinitly greater, becauſe then they have a clearer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the ſin, and offend after they have been delivered from the Slavery of Sin and the Devil: After they have received the grace of the Holy Ghoſt, by which there Soul became the dwelling place of God, ſo that by ſinning they violate the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:38446:92"/>Temple of God, and contriſtate the holy Spirit, which they baniſh from their Souls. Theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which ſo much aggravate the ſins of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are alſo the cauſe why God doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them with ſo much indulgence, but obligeth the Penitent after the remiſsion of the fault, to ſome ſatisfaction for the ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Certainly,</hi> ſaith the Council, Seſ. 14. c. 8. <hi>the equity of the divine juſtice requires that he ſhould deal otherwiſe with them, who before Baptiſm have ſinned by ignorance, then with them who by Holy Baptiſm have been delivered from the ſervitude of ſin and the Devil, and after they have received the gift of the Holy Ghoſt have not been afraid to violate the Temple of God and contriſtat his holy Spirit. Sanè &amp; divinae juſtitiae ratio exigere videtur, ut aliter ab eo in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam-recipiantur, qui ante Baptiſmum per ignorantiam deliquerint; aliter verò qui ſemel a peccati ſervitute liberati, &amp; accepto Spiritus ſancti dono, ſcienter Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum Dei violare, &amp; Spiritum ſanctum contriſtare non formidaverint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From thence the Council deſcends to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon, which they derive from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, which impoſes theſe puniſhments for our advantage, as followeth. <hi>Et divinam cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiam decet, ne ita nobis abſ<expan>

                     <hi>It is very agreeable to the divine bounty not to remit our ſins without obliging us to ſome Satisfaction, leſt by occaſion of too much mildneſs we ſhould think our ſins leſs then they are; and from thence take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to fall into greater, and to become injurious and contumelious to the Holy Ghoſt; and draw upon us

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Wherein Satisfaction conſiſts, and whether it be Eſſential to the Sacrament of Penance.</head>
                  <p>WE have already ſaid that it conſiſts in doing or ſuffering ſome painfull thing to recompence the Temporal puniſhment, which God hath reſerved after the remiſſion of ſin.</p>
                  <p>This ſatisfaction may be performed two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways, either in Vertue of the Sacrament by the impaition of the Prieſt, or out of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the ſole Devotion of the Penitent.</p>
                  <p>That only which is impoſed by the Prieſt is Sacramentall, and makes a part of the Sacrament of Pennance.</p>
                  <p>That which the Penitent performs upon his own free motion is an effect of the virtue of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with which his heart is fill'd; and altho' it do not make a part of the Sacrament, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs very profitable and wholſome; yea often very neceſſary to ſupply the defects of the Penance impoſed by Confeſſours, which ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come very ſhort of the puniſhment which their Sins deſerve in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>It may be ask'd whether Sacramental Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be eſſential to the Sacrament of Penance? that is to ſay, whether or no, it be ſo neceſſary, that without it the Sacrament would be in valid as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:38446:94"/>to the remiſſion of Sins?</p>
                  <p>To which it is neceſſary that we anſwer under a diſtinction betwixt Satisfaction effectual or actual, and affective only, which is a ſincere will to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy. For the firſt is not at all of the eſſence of the Sacrament, ſo as without it the Abſolution ſhould be null: for it is certain, that Abſolution may be given to a Penitent before he hath actually made any Satisfaction impoſed by the Prieſt; which is evident from the practice of the Church, which frequently gives Abſolution before Satisfaction be actually perform'd.</p>
                  <p>But as to the will of fatisfying God, it is ſo neceſſary, that without it the Abſolution would be of no effect: The reaſon is becauſe that will is inſeparable from true Contrition; and he who hath it not at all, cannot have the neceſſary ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his Sins, nor be truly Penitent: becauſe it is the proper effect of Penance to endeavour to deſtroy Sin, and repair the injury it doth to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith, 3. <hi>p. q.</hi> 85. <hi>a.</hi> 2. <hi>In Poenitentia invenitur ſpecialis ratio actus laudabilis: viz. operari ad deſtructionem peccati in quantum eſt offenſa Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides as it is not the intention of God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the Sin, but by obliging the Sinner to a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhment, ſo neither can it be, that he who will not, or doth not deſign to undergo that pain, receive the remiſſion of his Sins, which is not given him but upon condition to endure it. Moreover by that reſiſtance to the Divine Will he commits a Sin in his very Confeſsion, and by conſequence renders himſelf uncapable of Abſolution. This Concluſion we ſhall ſee more clearly hereafter in the Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Conditions Satisfaction ought to have on behalf of the Ghoſtly Father.</head>
                  <p>PEnance depends upon two perſons, the Prieſt that impoſes it, and the Penitent who accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and performs it. There are certain Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which it ought to have on either ſide. I ſhall ſpeak briefly of the one and the other, that not only the Penitent may know what he ought to do to acquit himſelf of it with advantage, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what the Confeſſour on his ſide is obliged to do, that he the Penitent may receive with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſubmiſſion and more obedience the Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ance which ſhall be enjoyn'd him.</p>
                  <p>The Penance then, which is enjoyned by the Confeſſor, muſt have three conditions: It muſt be Juſt, Charitable, and Prudent: that is, impos'd with juſtice, with charity, and with Prudence. with Juſtice, in regard to the Honour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of God; with Charity in reſpect of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Penitent; with Prudence in order to the forming a right judgment of the quality of the Penance, that the foreſight of the effects may follow.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three conditions correſpond to the three Characters of a Confeſſour in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Confeſſion, of a Judge, of a Father, of a Phyſician: he ought there to behave himſelf as a juſt Judge, as a charitable Father, and as a wiſe Phiſician.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it muſt be Juſt, that is proportion'd to the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:38446:95"/>Sins, as well in reſpect of the enormity, as the number; for if the Penance be too rigorous, it is an injuſtice in reſpect of the Penitent: if it be too light or eaſy, it is an injuſtice done to God. The firſt happens very ſeldome, but the ſecond frequently, and renders the Confeſſours very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten extreamly culpable in the ſight of God: which are the reaſons why God, as S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> ſaith, doth not receive from Penitents the Satisfaction which is due unto him. <hi>Laborant, ne Deo ſatisfiat</hi> lib 1. ep. 3.</p>
                  <p>This proportion of the Penance with the Sin is not to be underſtood of an exact and rigorous proportion; for that cannot poſſibly be obſerved by man, none but God knowing the Puniſhment which each Sin deſerves. But it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a Morall and prudent proportion; ſo that a greater proportion be aſſigned to greater or more numerous Sins; and a leſſer, for leſs heinous and fewer Sins: All this muſt be enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the ability of the Penitent, which depends upon the ſtrength of their bodys, the diſpoſition of their minds, their age, their ſex, their ſtate, and the like.</p>
                  <p>And in this the Confeſſors ought to proceed with much circumſpection, remembring that they are not the abſolute Maſters and Arbiters in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Penances, as they pleaſe; but that they act as Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt: and that it doth not appertain to the ſervant to diſpoſe at his pleaſure of what belongs to his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſpeaking of Satisfaction, gives this advertiſment to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, worthy to be obſerv'd, and which they ought always to have before their eyes: I ſhall
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:38446:95"/>cite it in this place not only for the Confeſſours, but alſo for the Penitents ſake; that they may know in this point the obligations heir Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours have; and that they may underſtand, that they are not abſolute maſters of the Penances they enjoyn,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Preiſts of our Lord,</hi> ſaith the Council ſeſ. 14. c. 8. <hi>ought, as far as the Holy Ghoſt and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall ſuggeſt unto them, to enjoyn convenient and wholſome penances, having regard to the quality of the Sins, and the ability of the Penitents: for fear leſt if they ſhould connive at their Sins, and uſe them too indulgently, enjoyning ſome light works for moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crimes, they may become partakers of others Sins:</hi> and afterwards they add, <hi>That they have a particular care that the Penances they impoſe be not only a means to conſerve the Penitents in Grace and cure their infirmities, but alſo ſerve to puniſh their paſt offences. Debent ergo Sacerdotes Domini, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Spiritus &amp; prudentia ſuggeſſerit, pro qualitate cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum &amp; poenitentium facultate, ſalutares &amp; conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes ſatisfactiones injungere; ne ſi forte peccatis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveant, &amp; indulgentiùs cum penitentibus agant, leviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima quaedam opera pro graviſſimis delictis injungendo, alienorum peccatorum participes efficiantur. Habeant autem prae oculis ut ſatisfactio quam imponunt, non ſit tantùm ad novae vitae cuſtodiam, &amp; infirmitatis medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentum, ſed etiam ad praeteritorum peccatorum vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictam, &amp; caſtigationem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Penitents would but conſider well this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, and the obligation which their Confeſſours have to weigh well the penances they enioyn them; they would not complain, as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they do, that their penances are too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, whereas they are far inferiour to what they deſerve.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:38446:96"/>
                  <p>Next to Juſtice, Charity is neceſſary in enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Penance, where the Prieſt ought to be mindfull, that he is a Father of his Penitent, to communicate unto him the life of grace. Now this is to be underſtood of a true &amp; reall Charity and according to the will of God, which is the Salvation of the Sinner, and which conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought to make him only ſolicitous for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Penitent, uſing to that end both mild and ſevere remedies as he ſhall judg moſt proper and moſt convenient.</p>
                  <p>Thus Charity avoids two extreams, the one of too ſevere Confeſſours, who behave themſelves in regard of their Penitents, as ſome Fathers do towards their Children; whom they treat always with ſo much rigour, that they rather ruin them, then amend them. The other is of too ſoft and indulgent Confeſſours, who either following their own facil and complaiſant nature, or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently performing that dreadfull Office, treat all their Penitents with an equall, but leſs diſcreet, ſweetneſs, enjoyning ordinarily but ſlight pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for Mortall Sins, how great or how nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſo ever they be.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two extreams are vicious, and have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently very ill conſequences, for the former renders Confeſſion troubleſome and tedious, and diſcourageth Penitents. The other makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, or of little or no effect for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. This indiſcreet mildneſs fauſters them in their vices, without putting them to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to correct them; as we ſee by too frequent experience, and the acknowledgment of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents themſelves, who frequently avouch that this exceſſive mildneſs hath been very prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:38446:96"/>to them; and indulged them in their Sins.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Ghoſtly fathers ought firſt to remember that by this their mildneſs, they become guilty of others Sins, according to the above ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted advertiſement of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in the 3. <hi>ch.</hi> Secondly, they wrong their Penitents in an high degree whilſt they think to favour them. They hinder them from doing Penance, and from ſatisfying God by their good works, and are the cauſes why they relapſe into their Sins. This is the Doctrine which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers in his 14. <hi>Epiſt. Haec qui ſubtrahit fratribus, decipit miſerios, ut qui poſſunt agere poenitentiam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, &amp; Deo patri &amp; miſericordi precibus &amp; operibus ſuis ſatisfacere, ſeducantur ut magis peccent.</hi> And moreover they ought to conſider that they are no leſs injurious to the Sacrament of Penance, and to other Confeſſours, who adminiſter that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as they ought, with more exactneſs. For the Penitents accuſtomed to this great indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence cannot endure Confeſſours, who are more exact in their duty, altho' they treat them with all the prudence imaginable, &amp; with much Charity. They complain of them, they condemn them, they fly from them, and ſeek out the moſt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and moſt commonly the moſt negligent in the performance of their duty.</p>
                  <p>There is a mean to be obſerved betwixt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſweetneſs; we muſt mingle and temper the one with the other; as well in the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are proper to be given them, as in the penances one ought to enjoyn: And all this conformable to the diſpoſitions of the Penitent; for we muſt act with more ſweetneſs, with an humble and contrite Spirit, and with more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:38446:97"/>with him, who is void of theſe good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: we muſt employ mildneſs towards time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Souls, and Severity towards thoſe, who are hard and difficult to be moved; and ſo of others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there remains Prudence, which is the third condition which Penance ought to have. This is that which governs and directs the two prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conditions, Juſtice &amp; Charity, &amp; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them in their proper place, &amp; as they ought to be. Now this is not meer humane Prudence only, but a Prudence inſpired by God, and which we ought to beg of him. Wherefore the Council ſaid above, <hi>As much as the Holy Spirit and Prudence ſhall ſuggeſt unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Prudence in the enjoyning of Penance conſiſts in the obſervance of many things, but particularly three. <hi>viz.</hi> that the Penitent be able to comply with the penance; That it be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to him; And that it be ſecret for ſecret Sins.</p>
                  <p>The Confeſſour muſt foreſee whether or no the Penitent be able to perform the penance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd him; he muſt enquire of him whether he can comply with it; and know whether he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the reaſons he alledgeth; and he muſt either ſhew him the means how to perform it, or give him another penance.</p>
                  <p>He muſt, as much as poſſible, enjoyn ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as may be for the Salvation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Penitent, ſo that making ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the divine Juſtice, he may be confirmed in his grace and in the way of virtue. This is done excellently by the impoſition of ſuch ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pains, as ſerve alſo for a remedy againſt the Spirituall diſtempers of the Penitent. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:38446:97"/>Faſting againſt intemperance and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Alms-deeds againſt Covetouſneſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the Penance muſt be Secret; that is, ſuch as may be ſecretly performed, and without being taken notice of by others; ſo that there be no rational fear, that by the Penance the Penitent may be judg'd to have committed ſome notorious Sin, from whence Scandal may ariſe to others, and infamy to the Penitent.</p>
                  <p>This is to be underſtood, when the Sin is Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and the Penitent is in good repute amongſt thoſe with whom he lives; for if the Sins are publick or known to others, or if he be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a very good and virtuous man, it is not only no harm, that the Penance be known to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but it is often very proper and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſary, that he may edify thoſe by his Penance and Coverſion, whom he had ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by his wicked way of living.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Conditions of Satisfaction in respect of the Penitent.</head>
                  <p>THE Penitent contributes two things to the Sacrament of Penance, the acceptance of it; and the putting it in execution; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the conditions which it requires of him are, that it be well accepted, and duly performed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Penance muſt be well accepted, and before the acceptance it is no part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath it,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38446:98"/>the Sacrament is compoſed of three actions of the Pentient, Contrition, Confeſſion, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Now Satisfaction begins to be an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Penitent by acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is not only neceſſary that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance be accepted, that ſo it may be a part of the Sacrament; but the Penitent alſo is obliged to accept it, if he intend to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>This Second follows out of the foregoing truth; for the non-acceptance of the Penance would render the Sacrament defective at leaſt in the integrity of its parts; nay, more, it would ſignify that he hath no mind to ſatisfy the Divine juſtice, and yet this mind or will is eſſential to the Sacrament, and neceſſarily included in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition; as is above declared.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Penitent is not only obliged to receive ſuch a Satisfaction as himſelf thinks fit, but ſuch an one as the Prieſt ſhall judge reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And the reaſon is, becauſe the Prieſt is his Judge having power to oblige him to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at the ſame time he remits his ſins; and by conſequence the Penitent ought to follow, and ſubmit himſelf to the judgment of the Prieſt: and if he refuſe the Prieſt may deny to give him Abſolution.</p>
                  <p>The Catechiſm of the Council of <hi>Trent, de Penit. Sacram. n.</hi> 29. declares this truth in terms very proper to be cited in this place, to convince the Penitents of this their obligation. See how it ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Penitentia eſt veluti quaedam delictorum compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, ab ejus Voluntate profecta, qui delinquit, ac Dei arbitrio in quem peccatum commiſſum eſt, conſtituta.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:38446:98"/>Quare &amp; voluntas compenſandi requiritur, in quo maxime contritio verſatur, &amp; Penitens ſacerdotis judicio, qui Dei perſonam gerit, ſe ſubjiciat, neceſſe eſt; ut pro ſcelerum magnitudine paenam conſtituere in eum poſſit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Penance is a certain Compenſation or recompence for Sins,</hi> that is, a vertue or action by which one gives to God in ſome ſort the honour which he had taken from him, <hi>proceeding from the will of him who hath offended; and appointed by the will of God againſt whom the Sin was committed: wherefore the will of making recompence is alſo required in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as being the cheif part of Contrition: and it is a neceſſity incumbent upon the Penitent, to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the judgment of the Prieſt who repreſents in that place the perſon of God, that he may ordain a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment according to the greatneſs of the Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Authority Penitents may ſee the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation they have to ſubmit themſelves to their Confeſſours, and accept of the Penance they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, in which Confeſſours alſo ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with much diſcretion, as we have ſaid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding always what is moſt expedient for the Salvation of the Penitent.</p>
                  <p>In fine, that this acceptance of the Penance may be well performed, it muſt be done with theſe three conditions, humbly, willingly, and ſincerely.</p>
                  <p>Accept it then humbly <hi>Theotime,</hi> that is, with reſpect, ſubmitting your ſelf to the judgment of your Confeſſor, as your Judge, your Father, and your Phyſician, and of him that holds the place of God: if you find any difficulty in what he ſhall ordain, declare it modeſtly and follow his directions.</p>
                  <p>Accept it willingly, acknowledging that you
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:38446:99"/>deſerve a greater puniſhment, and that this chaſtiſement is far leſs than what you owe to the Divine juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Accept it ſincerely, that is, with a good and ſteddy will fully to perform all he ſhall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you.</p>
                  <p>As to the performance of the Penance, it ought to be exact and faithfully complied with: there is an obligation to diſcharge ones ſelf of this Duty. Firſt, becauſe it is a part and belongs to the perfection of the Sacrament: 2ly, becauſe it is enjoyn'd by an authority, which hath power to oblige, ſince God hath declared, that to be bound in Heaven which the Prieſt binds upon Earth. 3ly, becauſe it is in vertue of that accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance one receives abſolution.</p>
                  <p>There is then an obligation of complying with that penance, which one hath accepted; and he who on ſet purpoſe, or by willfull negligence fails to perform it, commits a Sin and an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt God: and this more or leſs grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, according as the omiſſion is more or leſs conſiderable; for if it be but a ſlight omiſſion, it is but a venial Sin; but if it be a notorious omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as of the whole penance, or the greateſt part of it, it may be a mortal Sin: which is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood if the Penance was enjoyn'd in ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for a Mortal Sin.</p>
                  <p>Acquit your ſelf then faithfully, <hi>Theotime,</hi> of your Penance, as obeying God in the perſon of your Confeſſour; diſcharge your ſelf of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you have made him, and compleat the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>But remember to perform it willingly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly, and ſecretly.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:38446:99"/>
                  <p>Willingly, to avoid the fault which thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit who never perform it but with pain and trouble, whereby they looſe the greateſt part of the merit they might otherwiſe have. It is a ſtrange thing that men ſhould run after Sin with ſo much earneſtneſs and pleaſure, and ſhould have ſuch an Averſion and Horrour againſt Penance which is a remedy againſt it: And this is the complaint which <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes of his time. <hi>Nauſeabit ad antidotum qui hiavit ad venenum.</hi> We nauſeate the Remedy, and love the Poyſon.</p>
                  <p>Perform it alſo devoutly, but eſpecially with a true Spirit of repentance, and an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it is a certain ſatisfaction you make to God for the injury you have done him by your Sins. Place them always before your eyes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore them as David did, <hi>iniquicatem meam ego cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſco, &amp; peccatum meum contra me eſt ſemper.</hi> Pſal. 50.4.</p>
                  <p>In fine, perform your Penance ſecretly, if it be great, and if it be given you for great Sins, but which are altogether unknown to thoſe amongſt whom you live; that you may neither ſcandaliſe any one, nor defame your ſelf: It was for theſe two reaſons, we ſaid in the precedent Chapter, that the Preiſt ought to enjoyn ſuch a penance that may be ſecretly comply'd with when the Sins are wholly ſecret; and the Penitent alſo muſt keep his Penance ſecret, that he may avoid the ſame inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>And yet this is a thing wherein Penitents and particularly young people are frequently faulty, declaring indiſcreetly their penances to others, which cannot but be of very ill conſequence, when
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:38446:100"/>their penances are ſignall and notorious.</p>
                  <p>If the penance be enjoyn'd you for Sins that are known to others; as you ought not to affect to publiſh it, ſo neither ought you to avoid the making of it known; being it may ſerve for the edification of others, and ſatisfy for the ſcandal, which your Sins have cauſed.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Works which may be enjoyn'd for Penance.</head>
                  <p>THe moſt ordinary works of Penance are prayer, faſting, almsdeeds, and whatſoever may have a relation to any of theſe three: ſuch as in reſpect of Prayer, are reading pious books, Meditation, Confeſſion, hearing Maſs.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of faſting, all the Mortifications of the body, Labour, retrenching our ſelves even of lawfull Pleaſures, Abſtinence from things either Hurtfull, or Dangerous.</p>
                  <p>In regard of Alms, all the Helps and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances one can give to their Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three ſorts of works are very proper for Penance, and agree with it admirably well.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, by theſe three works we ſubmit to God all the goods which we poſſeſs, the goods of the Mind, thoſe of the Body, and of Fortune. The goods of the mind by Prayer, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Spirit to God; thoſe of the Body by Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and other Mortifications; and thoſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by Almsdeeds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe almoſt all our Sins conſiſt in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:38446:100"/>the abuſe of ſome of theſe three things. Pride proceeds from the abuſe of the goods or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the mind; Luxury, from thoſe of the goods of the Body; and from the abuſe of our Riches proceeds Covetouſneſs: We repair that abuſe by the three above-mentioned works. Prayer humbles the mind, Faſting tames the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Alms makes good uſe of Riches.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three works are highly praiſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Scripture, as having a wonderfull force to appeaſe Gods anger after Sin, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of him all manner of favours.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid of prayers, <hi>Judith.</hi> 9.16. <hi>That the Prayers of the humble and good have always been pleaſing to God.</hi> Eccle. 35.21. <hi>That the Prayer of him that humbles himſelf penetrates the Clouds.</hi> Peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as I may ſay, the Heavens to mount to the Divine Throne and make it ſelf be underſtood and graciouſly heard. This made St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſay, that it is the ſame for Prayer to aſcend unto Heaven, as for Mercy to deſcend from thence. <hi>Aſcendit Oratio, &amp; deſcendit miſeratio.</hi> And he adds elſewhere, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to make Prayer mount more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to Heaven, it is good to give it two wings, <hi>viz.</hi> Faſting and Alms.</p>
                  <p>As for Faſting, it is ſaid, <hi>Tob.</hi> 12.8. <hi>That Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is good with Faſting.</hi> That the Faſting and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Ninevites</hi> appeaſed Gods wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. When God exhorts his People to penance, he aſſignes faſting as one of the moſt efficacious means. <hi>Convert your ſelves to me in Faſting, Tears, and Lamentations.</hi> Joel. 2.13.</p>
                  <p>And as for Alms, it is ſaid, Tob. 4.11. <hi>That it delivers from Sin and Death. And that it will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the Soul which gives it ſhould be loſt.</hi> That
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:38446:101"/>Dan. 4.24. <hi>by it</hi> we muſt <hi>redeem</hi> our <hi>Sins.</hi> That <hi>Eccl.</hi> 29.15. we muſt <hi>hide</hi> our <hi>almes in the boſome of the poor, and it will Pray and obtain of God an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from all evil for him that does it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a great number of other paſſages in the Holy Scripture to ſhew how powerfull theſe three works are to obtain the mercy of God, and remiſſion of Sins.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three works have each of them three ſingular qualities, which render them more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and commend them to our more frequent practiſe. For they are Satisfactory, Meritorious, and impetratorious.</p>
                  <p>They are Satisfactorious in reſpect of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment, by reaſon of the trouble which they give of Sins paſt, either to the Body or Mind; and by theſe pains or trouble willingly undergone, one Satisfies for the puniſhments which are due to the Sins he hath committed.</p>
                  <p>They are meritorious in reſpect of grace and glory; which is common to all good works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the ſtate of Sanctifying grace.</p>
                  <p>They are impetratorious, that is they have a particular vertue whereby to obtain of God the favours which we demand, and that according to the intention of thoſe who do them: and by how much better, that is, with more Fervour, and with a more Humble &amp; Contrite Spirit they are performed; by ſo much more eaſily they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what they demand.</p>
                  <p>In fine, with all theſe admirable qualities, they have yet another of no leſs note, which in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould make them more lovely &amp; more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And it is this, they are good againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies of the Soul; and ſerve not only as a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:38446:101"/>to cure paſt Sins, but alſo as a preſervative againſt them for the future.</p>

                  <p>IT is a great errour and very common amongſt Penitents to ſatisfy themſelves if they comply with the Penance that is enjoyned them, and to believe that they have done enough, when they have performed the Penance ſuch as it was, tho' frequently far inferiour to what it ought to be. This abuſe is the cauſe of many evils, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly above the reſt of the ſmall progreſs one makes in vertue, of looſe living, and relapſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin; it being certain that if we did Penance as we ought, for our paſt offences, we ſhould not ſo eaſily fall into other ſins.</p>
                  <p>Miſtake not then <hi>Theotime,</hi> but be perſwaded that you ought to do other Penances beſides thoſe that are enjoyned you in your Confeſſions, and this for ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the better to ſatisfy the Divine Juſtice for your paſt Sins, and by little and little to diminiſh the puniſhment, which yet remains due from you to be payed. 2ly, to make you more gratefull and acceptable in the ſight of God after your Sins, and to merit at his hands thoſe graces, which by your former crimes you had juſtly loſt. 3ly. To reſtrain you from offending God, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:38446:102"/>relapſing into thoſe Sins, for which you ſee your ſelf obliged to ſuffer. 4ly. To cure the vicious and wicked inclinations of your Soul, by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the acts of contrary virtues.</p>
                  <p>All theſe are the reaſons of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> cited above in the 5th Chapter; to which I refer my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This is the cauſe why the ſame Council hath ſaid, <hi>Seſ.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 13. That the Life of a Chriſtian <hi>ought to be a perpetual Penance: and that the juſt ought to work their Salvation with fear and trembling, by Labour, by Watchings, Almsdeeds, Prayers, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and by Chaſtity.</hi> And theſe maxims are drawn from the Goſpell, &amp; the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles ſo that there is not the leaſt ground to doubt of the truth thereof.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> I exhort you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſeriouſly upon this truth, and convince your ſelf, that it is neceſſary for you to do Penance in whatſoever ſtate you are, if you intend to live like a Chriſtian. It is a great errour to beleive that Penance belongs only to Religious, it is the duty of all Chriſtians, and of all thoſe that hope to ſave their Souls. But you will ask me how it is to be done? Behold the moſt eaſy means can be imagined.</p>
                  <p>Penance conſiſts in two things, in a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin, and in ſuffering in order to ſatisfy for the injury it hath done to God. One of theſe is in the heart, the other in action; Comply with them both, and you will perform a very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Penance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſerve always in your heart a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret or ſorowfull ſenſe for having offended God. And to conſerve it better accuſtome your ſelf
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:38446:102"/>dayly to renew it, &amp; elicit acts of ſorrow in your prayers, as at Morning and Night, demanding of him pardon for your Sins, and deteſting them from the bottom of your heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuffer for your Sins, and that two ways: firſt, by impoſing upon your ſelf ſome action of Penance to perform every day. One while a recital of ſome prayers, otherwhile a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of almes, ſometimes mortification, as abſtinence, or retrenchment of ſome lawfull pleaſures, as divertiſements, or the like. But all this muſt be done upon the motive of making ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for injurys done to God, which is the Spirit of Penance. 2ly. accepting willingly and with the ſame ſpirit of Penance, and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the pains and evils which dayly befall you; As the inconveniences of Life, the diſorders of Body, the troubles of mind, diſguſts, loſs of goods, poverty, neceſſities, afflictions either private, or publick; and generally all the evills which occur, and whereof this life is ſo fertile, and abounding: But eſpecially the particular pains and hardſhips, which you are forced to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the ſtate and vocation where God hath placed you, there not being any where one is not obliged to labour and take pains.</p>
                  <p>All theſe afflictions and troubles we may make uſe of to do penance and ſatisfy for our Sins, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition we ſuffer them with patience, (as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath declared, <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 8 &amp;. 9.) and with ſorrow for our offences. Whereas on the contrary when we undergo them without patience, and without offering them up to God, for the remiſſion of our Sins, and for ſatisfaction of the puniſhment which we have deſerved, our
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:38446:103"/>ſufferings are not only not mitigated, but alſo render'd unprofitable, without bringing either any benefit for the future, or any Comfort for the preſent; which is a thing which we ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well in this place.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Sacramentall Abſolution. What it is. Wherein it conſiſts, and what are its Effects.</head>
                  <p>ALtho' Abſolution be a part of the Prieſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, yet it is very fitting that the Penitents ſhould be inſtructed in it, to the end they may receive it with reſpect and ſutable diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he muſt know, that as in every Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there are two parts, whereof one is called the matter, the other the form. Abſolution is the form of the Sacrament of penance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it there is neither a Sacrament, nor remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins by vertue of it.</p>
                  <p>This Abſolution is a juridicall ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Prieſt upon the Penitent, by which, after that he hath taken cogniſance of the Sins which the Penitent hath confeſſed, and of his good diſpoſition to receive the remiſsion of them; and after that he hath enjoyned him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Penance, he remits his Sins on the behalf of God and by the authority which he hath given him.</p>
                  <p>It conſiſts but in theſe three words, which are eſſentiall to it. <hi>I abſolve thee from thy Sins,</hi> all the other which the Prieſts ſays before and after
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:38446:103"/>them, are Prayers which the Holy Church hath inſtituted to implore the Grace and Mercy of God upon the Penitent; and which may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in caſe of neceſsity.</p>
                  <p>The effects of the Abſolution are to remit the Sin as far as concerns the fault or offence of God, and the Eternall puniſhment: and blot out the ſtains which Sin had cauſed in the Soul; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the favour and freindſhip of God by the means of ſanctifying Grace, which it beſtows upon him; and revive in him all the precedent merits, which were mortifyed and loſt by ſin.</p>
                  <p>It produceth all theſe effects in the moment that it is pronounced. And in that happy moment is wrought this wonderfull change of a Soul, which is tranſlated from the ſtate of Sin to that of Grace, and from the ſlavery of the Devil, to the Bleſſed liberty of the Children of God.</p>
                  <p>O Bleſſed moment! <hi>Theotime,</hi> O Fortunate change! If we knew how to conceive it right, how ſhould we bleſs God, <hi>qui dedit talem poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem hominibus:</hi> who hath given ſuch power to men? and what high eſteem ſhould we have of this Divine Sacrament?</p>

                     <hi>CHAP X.</hi> Of the dispoſitions neceſſary to receive Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and of the caſes where it ought to be denied or deferred.</head>
                  <p>THis is a point in which it is truly neceſſary that Penitents be well inſtructed. For the greateſt part of them imagin, that when they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:38446:104"/>have confeſſed their Sins, there remains nothing more then to receive abſolution, and that the Confeſſor without further difficulty is obliged to give it them; which is a very great errour, becauſe the Confeſſor ought to know the diſpoſitions of the Penitent, and judge whether or no he be in a fit ſtate to receive it: without which he would commit a Sacrilege, abſolving one unworthy, in ſtead of conferring a Sacrament; of which he ought to be very carefull.</p>
                  <p>He muſt then know &amp; judge whether the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent be ſufficiently diſpoſed to receive the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. And being theſe diſpoſitions conſiſt in two things, to be well Confeſs'd, and to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Contrite for his Sins, he muſt judg of them both, and if he know him to be deficient in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two, or juſtly doubt that he is, he ought to deny the Abſolution, or defer it till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time.</p>
                  <p>Firſt as to the Confeſſion, He muſt judg whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be entire and true, and made with requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite preparation. If he perceive that the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hath not examined his Conſcience, he muſt oblige him to take more time to call to mind his ſins. If he judg that he doth not declare all his ſins and conceals any one, he ought diſcreetly to diſmiſs him, provided he have a juſt ground to form that judgment. For example, if he ſee that the Penitent confeſſes himſelf with trouble, and that he is very much aſhamed to confeſs his Sins. If he know by ſome other way, that he hath committed ſome Sin, whereof he doth not accuſe himſelf, provided that he know it not by anothers Confeſſion, which is a knowledg where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he can make no uſe.</p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:38446:104"/>
                  <p>As to Contrition. The Confeſſour ought to underſtand whether the Penitent have that which is ſufficient; and if he judge that he hath not, he cannot abſolve him.</p>
                  <p>This judgment may be made one of theſe two ways, certainly, or under a doubt only, but that well grounded. In the firſt caſe he ought to deny abſolution, in the ſecond it is his duty to defer it. The Confeſſour judgeth with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that Contrition is wanting in theſe three following caſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when the Penitent gives not the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour ſign of it, but is dull and inſenſible to all that the Confeſſor tells him. In that caſe, ſaith the Catechiſm of the Councill, the Confeſſour ſeeing that the Penitent is not at all moved with compunction of his Sins, muſt mildly and with ſweetneſs diſmiſs him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when either the Penitent doth not ſeriouſly promiſe amendment, or when he doth promiſe it, but will not perform what is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to effect it, ſuch as are to quit the immediate occaſion of Sin, the company of one who makes him offend God, naughty, depraved, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevious books, play or games that make him ſwear.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when he will not perform theſe things to which he is obliged, as to reſtore ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten goods, pardon his enemies, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to them.</p>
                  <p>In theſe three caſes the Confeſſour ought to deny abſolution, becauſe the Penitent is not at all in a ſtate fit to receive it.</p>
                  <p>He muſt alſo deny it, when the Penitent is guilty of any ſin, reſerved to a Superiour. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:38446:105"/>in this caſe, he hath not power to abſolve him.</p>
                  <p>There are other caſes where he cannot ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly judge of the want of true Contrition; but where however he may reaſonably doubt it. And this frequently is the cauſe of much trouble to the Confeſſour, who conſiders on the one ſide that he is obliged in conſcience to deny abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him that is unworthy of it, as he hath reaſon to judge that ſuch a Penitent is; on the other ſide findes himſelf preſs'd by the Penitent to give it, who judges always in his own favour, and ordinarily believes himſelf better diſpoſed then in reality he is.</p>
                  <p>This difficulty and this doubt happens upon ſeveral occaſions, which it would be hard and too long to recount here in particular, but one above the reſt is very ordinary; that is, when the Penitent after his Confeſſions relapſes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into his mortal Sins, without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of his Life. For altho' every time he confeſſes, he teſtifies his ſorrowfull ſenſe for his ſins, and promiſes to amend; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs having already failed ſo often in his promiſe, one may reaſonably doubt, whether this laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of amendment be reall and ſincere, or no.</p>

                  <p>COuld I but ſee Penitents with the ſame care and Sollicitude, endeavouring to cure the preſent and obviate the future diſeaſes of their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:38446:105"/>Soul, that divine particle; as I ſee them curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in repairing and occurring to the infirmities of the Body, that frail peice of Mortality; how unexcuſable, O God, ſhould I think any advice upon the Subject of the election of a Confeſſour.</p>
                  <p>But, alas, when the body is concern'd there is not any one, who is ſatisfyed with the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian who is next at hand; much leſs doth rely upon him whom he thinks unskillfull. None was ever heard to ſay in a greivous ſickneſs; any one ſo he be a Phyſitian is good enough for me; It is not then the ſole Character can ſatisfy the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of the Patient; it is not the bare profeſſion (with let his arrogance be puniſhed; if he know no better) which puts a ſtop to his inquiſitive concern in point of health.</p>
                  <p>No no, <hi>Theotime,</hi> in the urgent neceſſity of a dangerous ſickneſs, the Illiterate, Unskilfull, or unexperienc't Phyſitian is not ſought for; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he be thought leſs then mad, who ſhould prefer the judgment of the unlearned, when his malady required the moſt knowing artiſt.</p>
                  <p>Whereas this is the prepoſterous method Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents ordinarily take in chooſing a Confeſſour the Phyſitian of their Souls: when they ly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in that fatal diſeaſe of Mortal Sin; when upon the recovery depends eternal health or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: that Doctor is thought to have skill enough, who dares profeſs his function, for if, ſay they, he did not know his duty, he would not expoſe himſelf. And then it is that the firſt may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps moſt wellcome.</p>
                  <p>And thus it is with many, who ſeem fond to delude themſelves with ſuch ſpecious pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:38446:106"/>and appear even to be convinc't with a gloſs of reaſon in things of the greateſt moment, whilſt the beſt of arguments are all too little in matters of leſs concern; as in the ſickneſs of the Soul they ſeek no furthet then barely the profeſſion; but when the Body is afflicted you ſhall have nice diſtinctions betwixt Phyſitians and Phyſitians, Sickneſs and Sickneſs; all indeed may be Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, but they are not all equally endowed with natural parts, Learning, and Experience; and there are ſome Sickneſſes more dangerous then others, that require the moſt eminent Doctors; many frequently dy in the hands of the unskill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and how do I know, what my infirmity may be? I grant they proceed upon good grounds; in this their care of the Body; and deſire no more but that they will do the ſame in the diſtempers of the Soul, and the choice of a Confeſſor.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome, which is lamentable to think on, ſo far from this and ſo blindly fooliſh, as to reject the better, and apply themſelves to thoſe whom they know leſs able either to diſcern their malidies or to correct the vitious humours, or to let them ſee the number, greatneſs, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normity of their paſt Sins, to create in their Souls an horror of them, or make them ſenſible of what the malignity may grow to, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by timely repentance. They chooſe thoſe who are leſs prudent in their preſcriptions, and leſs capable to give ſuitable admonitions, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary advices, and other remedies againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies of the Soul; the moſt indulgent in their Penances, the moſt facile in reſolution of caſes of conſcience, thoſe in fine who dive leaſt into their conſciences, who paſs ſlieghtly over all
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:38446:106"/>things, are leaſt troubleſome in queſtions, give little or no advice, and that which they give on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a generall without deſcending to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, who ſatisfy themſelves with what is told them and from a ſlight Penance paſs over to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. And theſe are the Confeſſors not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt followed, but moſt ſought after.</p>
                  <p>Now is not this a deplorable blindneſs? Is not this willingly to extinguiſh the light of reaſon, that they may more freely and without remorſe of Conſcience fall into the pit of Hell.</p>
                  <p>Are not Chriſtians miſerably unfortunate in verifying by their practiſes that greivous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which God once made againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> Iſay. 30.9. <hi>This people</hi> ſaid he, <hi>continually provokes my Wrath, theſe are deceitfull Children that will not hearken to the Law of God, who ſay unto the Seers, ſee not, and to the wiſe, ſearch not good things for us; but ſpeak pleaſing things unto us; entertain us with errours and falſities?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what diſorders accrue to poor penitents by the remiſsneſs of ſuch Confeſſors. Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions become purely cuſtomary, not prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpirit of Penance. The reiteration takes off the ſhame and confuſion due to their Sins; want of reprehenſion continues them in their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and by their frequent relapſes at laſt they deſerve to be thrown headlong down the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall precipice of Damnation.</p>
                  <p>And whence all this? But from negligent, ignorant, looſe, or obſequious Confeſſors; who reſemble thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> people to whom <hi>Jeremy</hi> doth attribute the cauſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Thren. 2.14. <hi>Your Prophets have declared unto them Falſities and fooleries, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:38446:107"/>have they made you know your iniquities, to move you to do Penance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if by this plea ſuch like Confeſſors are found guity of the damnation of Chriſtians; by the ſame certainly ſuch Penitents will be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who pleaſe themſelves in the choice of ſuch Confeſſors.</p>
                  <p>Therefore O <hi>Theotime,</hi> be not ſo far guilty of your own eternal ruin, as blindly to ſeek a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector by whom you may be blindly led; ſooth not your ſelf into your own deſtruction: But as you aim by your Confeſſion to ſet your ſelf in the right way to Heaven; ſo alſo let the choice of your guide be ſuch, that you may reaſonably expect by his means to obtain what you deſign; to be withdrawn from Vice, encouraged in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and ſecurely conducted in your way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life.

                  <p>I Treat here of this Subject becauſe I find it of great importance, and yet ſeldom expreſsly handled in other Treatiſes of Penance.</p>
                  <p>The Importance is ſufficiently evinc't in that the very Fruit and end of the Sacrament depends upon it, the Converſion of Sinners, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls.</p>
                  <p>Is it not in reality an unexpreſſible benefit for a Sinner to be reſtored to the grace of God, to be rankt a-new in the number of the Elect, and reſetled in the Inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven, after he had wilfully preſcrib'd his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Right, and juſtly deſerv'd to be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rejected?</p>
                  <p>But if this happy reſtauration, that was gained with trouble, be not preſerv'd with care, but eaſily loſt for want of compliance with our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what will it avail us? or rather what dire effects may we not expect from thence, from the wounds on the one ſide of a guilty Conſcience, and on the other from the vengeance of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:38446:108"/>
                  <p>Where is there a Malefactor to be found, who, having been once pardon'd of a Capital Crime purely by the Clemency of his Prince, dare by a repetition of his offence provoke the Juſtice of an injur'd bounty?</p>
                  <p>Or where a Perſon, but even now freed from a dangerous Sickneſs, that doth wilfully renew the declining Malady, or rather who doth not with all the Sollicitude imaginable prevent the fatality of a worſe relapſe?</p>
                  <p>But, alas! it is only where the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern is, that there the leaſt care is found. When Eternal Life in the next depends upon the good State of the Soul in this; 'tis then only that the danger of a relapſe, which is always worſe then the Original Diſeaſe, is not regarded; 'tis only in this caſe that the Patient ſtands obſtinately deaf to the advice of his Phyſitian.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians attempt that againſt God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Heaven and Earth, which either the fear of a Temporal Power would deter them from, or the Sacred name of Friend make them aſham'd of. For who is there that after reconciliation is not afraid to repeat continually the injuries of his Friend? and who is there that would not reaſonably judge that man a Cheat and Impoſtor, who ſhould pretend to the name of Friendſhip, and yet by a repetition of new offences continue to urge the good nature of his Friend; and by frequent relapſes make his patience the only Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their mutual amity, and his Facility in pardoning matter of ridiculing him to all the world.</p>
                  <p>Yet thus it is that Sinners treat with God. They confeſs their Sins, ask pardon, and time
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:38446:108"/>after time make their reconciliation with him by the Sacrament of Penance; and for ſome few days they curb their evil inclinations; but alas! they count not many from the time they return'd unto his favour, before they return to the offences by which they loſt it.</p>
                  <p>Thus they paſs all their Life Confeſſing from time to time, and continually returning to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin after Confeſſion; So that their whole life ſeems to be but one, as it were, continued Series or Succeſſion of Confeſſion and Relapſes into Mortal Sin: Now and then to Confeſs, to give their Conſcience a little eaſe and free it from ſome heinous Crime, by this way of proceeding ſeems to be only a diſpoſition to enſlave it in ſome other yet more enormous Sin; As if the Sacrament were inſtituted only for the remiſſion of paſt Sins, and not at all to give us ſtrength to avoid them for the future,</p>
                  <p>Good God, <hi>Theotime,</hi> Is it poſſible that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, believing Chriſtians, ſhould be guilty of this diſorder? That men endued with the light of Faith ſhould treat God after this unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unworthy manner? Is this to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature of the Sacrament of Penance, what it is? Is this to believe that it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reconciliation with God, not only by way of truce or for a time, but after the manner of a perpetual or eternal peace? is this to form a right judgment of his unlimited power, not to value his favour and Friendſhip? or do they (as indeed their repeated and cuſtomary offences ſpeak it) believe him only infinite in his attribute of Mercy, but not of Juſtice, ſo eaſily to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from that Grace, to which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:38446:109"/>by his only Mercy they have been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
                  <p>Did God only ſeldom and with much difficulty receive us again into his favour after we had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, every one would ſtand upon his guard; one would be afraid to fall again into his diſ-favour, and to hazzard his Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by an unfortunate relapſe. But being we think we ſhall be re-admitted into his favour when we pleaſe, and that there is no more to be done than to preſent our ſelves to him in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Penance to receive remiſſion of our Sins, we take the freedom to offend him on all occaſions. Thus we treat our God; and thus we take a motive from his goodneſs to continue to offend him; and to neglect that Sacred tye of his Friendſhip to that degree, as every moment to break its bonds. An affront one would not offer to the moſt contemptible Perſon living.</p>
                  <p>See then, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and conſider well of what great conſequence this Subject is; and how it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be ſolidly treated, and requires alſo your ſerious reflection.</p>

                  <p>ALL what I have ſaid doth ſufficiently evince the greatneſs and enormity of this evil; yet that you may be the more fully perſuaded of it, it is neceſſary that you learn it from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt himſelf, and by thoſe lights he hath vouchſafed to ſhew us in Holy Writ.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:38446:109"/>
                  <p>Firſt, the Wiſe Man in the 26th Chapter, verſe 25 of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> conſidering the greatneſs of this evil, declares, that he cannot behold it without a juſt indignation. He ſaith then, that there are two things, which when they happen grieve him very much; the one to ſee a great Warriour, after he hath ſerved a long time in the Campagne, reduc't to Poverty: the other to ſee a Wiſe Man deſpiſed, inſtead of being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, according to his merit: But he adds, that the third he is not able to endure; and that it cauſes in him a tranſport of the higheſt wrath; that is to ſee <hi>a man who falls from the State of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and Sanctity, <hi>to that of Sin,</hi> and who aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons Virtue to follow Vice; and he aſſures us that God will make that Perſon feel one day the effects of his Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>In another place he exclaims againſt thoſe who forſake the path of Virtue, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to Vice. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Woe be to you who have forſaken the right; and have declined into perverſe ways; what will you do when God ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ways</hi> and all the actions of your Life?</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle St <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. Ep. 2.20. inveighs with much zeal againſt thoſe who return to ſin after they have renounc't it by the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and declares that <hi>they fall back into a far worſe State or Condition than the former,</hi> from whence they were deliver'd by their Converſion, which was a State of darkneſs and Sin. <hi>That it had been better for them they had never known the Truth, than to have forſaken it, after they had known it. That their relapſe into Sin makes them reſemble the Dog, which returns to his vomit, and the Hog. which, after he hath been waſh'd, wallows in the mire.</hi>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:38446:110"/>What could be more emphatically ſaid againſt the relapſe into Sin? yet it is the Holy Ghoſt himſelf who ſpeaks it.</p>
                  <p>Add alſo that which he hath ſpoken upon this Subject by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent words, which we cited above in the Fourth Part, the third Chapter, in which he deſcribes with much energy the enormity of their fault, who relapſe into Sin after Baptiſm. He remarks four notorious circumſtances, which aggravate their firſt relapſe. The firſt is that they ſin after that they have been <hi>once</hi> delivered from the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Sin and the Devil. Mark this word <hi>Once.</hi> 2. That they ſin after they have received the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt. 3. That they ſin with knowledge, or knowingly. 4. That in ſinning they violate the Temple of God, and contriſtate his Holy Spirit.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of three great indignities which are found in the Sin of relapſe; The Ingratitude; The Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Contempt of God.</head>
                  <p>THis is to ſhew you yet more clearly the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs of the Sin of relapſe from three circumſtances which it includes, and which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it moſt enormous.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is a prodigious Ingratitude which it diſcovers towards God in offending him over and over, after innumerable benefits received from his hand; and above the reſt after he hath been by God's pure Mercy deliver'd not only once or
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:38446:110"/>twice, but many times, from Sin and eternal death.</p>
                  <p>Ponder well upon this ingratitude, <hi>Theotime,</hi> &amp; judge what it is for a Slave to be ungratefull to his Lord, his Redeemer, to him to whom he owes all he hath, in fine to God himſelf: If the <hi>Councill of Trent</hi> exaggerate with ſuch vigour the firſt ſin, which one commits after Baptiſm, upon this only account that it offends God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one hath been once deliver'd from the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Sin and the Devil; <hi>Semel a peccati &amp; Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis Servitute liberate.</hi> What would they ſay of thoſe, who fall back into ſin after they have been delivered from it, not once, but many times, only by the Sacrament of Penance? Was there ever an ingratitude parallel to this? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Haeccine, reddis Domino Popule ſtulte, &amp; inſipiens?</hi> O Chriſtian Souls! is it thus that you treat your God?</p>
                  <p>Muſt you not have loſt all your judgment and underſtanding to be thus forgetfull of the infinite favours of your Creator; and who after you have been admitted into his grace and favour conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to offend your maker?</p>
                  <p>But mark well, that he never accepted of that reconciliation but upon condition of a ſorowfull ſenſe, which you proteſted that you had to have offended him; and upon Promiſe, which you made to be faithfull to him not to offend him any more. So that you are not only ungratefull in offending anew, after he had pardon'd you; but alſo a perfidious man and a traytour, which is the ſecond indignity, which aggravates the Sin of a Relapſe. Perfidious, becauſe you acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your word, and contrary to the Solemne promiſe, which you made to God, that you
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:38446:111"/>would ſerve him for the future. A promiſe which you made not to a man, but to God himſelf So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly in the hands of the Church, and in the preſence of Angells. You would bluſh for ſhame, if you ſhould fail in your word to a man; and you make a cuſtome of it to be falſe to God, to whom nothing is more diſpleaſing then a promiſe ſlightly made, and ill comply'd with. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Diſplicet Deo infidelis, &amp; Stulta promiſſio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover you are not only perfidious, but your perfidiouſneſs is a certain treaſon which you commit againſt God; becauſe you rebell and deſert him to yield your ſelf over to his Enemy the Devil, and ſerve him anew againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This is that Sin, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſo ſtrongly in the Book of Penance; where he ſaith, that <hi>he who after he hath renounc'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by Penance, returns again to Sin, gives occaſion to the Enemy to rejoyce upon his return, and triumph againſt God, ſaying, I have regain'd the prey, which I had loſt. He ſubjoyns, that this is manifeſtly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Devil before God himſelf, when it being in his choice whether he will be for the one, or for the other, he ſo eaſily deſerts the Service of God, to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to that of his Enemy: and that by relapſe into Sin, he who before had a deſign to appeaſe God, by his Penance, as if he repented himſelf of that good action, becomes willing to make full ſatisfaction to the Devil by revoking his Penance, and doing Penance for that he hath done Penance for his Sins:</hi> rendring himſelf by this fatal change as <hi>hatefull in the ſight of God, as he will be wellcome to his enemy the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Weigh well theſe reflections, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and you will find they are all abſolutely true, not only for the ingratitude, and perſidious treachery, which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:38446:111"/>one is guilty of in regard of God, when after Penance he returns again to Sin; but alſo for the enormous contempt, which one ſhews, of his graces, and of God himſelf. For what greater affront can a perſon offer to God, to make leſs eſteem of his friendſhip, then of all thoſe trifling things for which one ſo eaſily relapſes into Sin? Is not this to eſteem and make great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er account of thoſe things, then of the grace of God: or as <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath it, <hi>to prefer the Devil</hi> who preſents them, <hi>before God</hi> who forbids them. <hi>Nonne diabolum Domino praeponit?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that I may make you truly ſenſible of the greatneſs of this contempt; I ask whether there can be a greater affront offer'd to a perſon, then not only continually to neglect his correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and all ſignes of amity, after he hath been honoured with his friendſhip; but dayly to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him anew after his reconciliation; to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtantly at diſtance with him, in hopes to be reſtored to his favour when one pleaſes? Would not every one ſay, that he who ſhould deal thus with his friend, would take him for a ſtupid, and a ſenſeleſs man, who had not the leaſt ſenſe to ſee himſelf ſo ſlighted; and his friendſhip ſet at nought; his favour, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure equally regarded? never was there ſeen an affront or contempt comparable to this. And yet this is that with which one treats Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, when he repeats his relapſes into Sin after confeſſion; a contempt which ought to make thoſe who are guilty of it tremble, at the juſt judgments of God. And this is what we are about to ſpeak of.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> That thoſe, who relapſe frequently into their Sins, ought to dread their Salvation.</head>
                  <p>THe generality of Chriſtians, who live habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated to Relapſes into Sin, are wont to ſay, that God is good and mereifull, and to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from this hope in his Mercy never to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their lives. Which is ſo intollerable an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that it can never be ſufficiently refelled.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, it is in this that the greatneſs and the exceſs of the contempt which is offer'd to God conſiſts, that one takes occaſion from his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy more heinouſly to offend him; and never continue long in his favour, ſince he believes it ſo eaſy to regain his Grace.</p>
                  <p>But in the next place, thoſe who make uſe of this pretext, reaſon and diſcourſe very ill, and deceive themſelves moſt ſhamefully; for though it be very true, that God is infinitely good and his mercies have no bounds; where did they ever find, that God is good to thoſe who deſpiſe him, and who truſt ſo much to his goodneſs, as not to apprehend, but ſlight his diſpleaſure? Holy writ tells us, that God is good to thoſe that are good: that he is good to thoſe that hope in him, and ſeek after him; that he ſhews mercy to thoſe who return unto him. But it is not any where ſaid, that he is good to thoſe that contemn and ſlight him: On the contrary he threatens them with dreadfull puniſhments. 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Qui contemnunt me erunt ignobiles:</hi> It is ſaid indeed,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:38446:112"/>that God ſhews mercy to Sinners who return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by repentance; but it is no where ſaid, that he hath promis'd mercy to all Sinners that they ſhall return. We are aſſured that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all thoſe, who truly converted from their Sins return unto him; but where is it ever ſaid that he receives thoſe who return not to him but with this reſtriction, for a time, upon occaſion of ſome great Solemnity; and then after a little time willingly fall back into their Sins?</p>
                  <p>This is not found in any place of Holy writ: But on the contrary we find there dreadfull and terrible menaces againſt thoſe, who treat God with ſuch infidelity, and ſo great contempt. I ſhall produce two remarkable paſſages of this kind; the one out of the Old, the other from the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is drawn from the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> newly departed out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God was fallen into Captivity, and under the Tyranny of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> under which they had groan'd for a long time overwhelmed with labours, and miſeries. God by a peculiar mercy withdraws them from it, working many prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and great miracles in their favour; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt the death of the firſt-born of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> the paſſage through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dry land, ſo to free them from the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Enemies, who purſued them with a Powerfull Army. He conducted them all that way by means of a Pillar of Fire, which marched before them: he fed them with <hi>Manna,</hi> which he ſhower'd from Heaven every morning. This dull and ungratefull people in the midſt of all theſe favours and divine careſſes revolt from God,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:38446:113"/>repenting themſelves, that ever they had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Egypt</hi> (where they had lived ſo long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with ſo much miſery) wiſhing every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to return back thither; murmuring againſt God upon every the leaſt occaſion, and diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Providence, and Almighty Power. God is often inconſed againſt them, and puniſheth them ſo ſeverely, that many times this people taught by afflictions, returned to the duty, and obedience due to their God, and their Redeemer. But this their Repentance laſted not long; for upon every firſt occaſion they fell back to their wonted infidelity.</p>
                  <p>One there was, the height or chief of all the reſt, which was the occaſion of their utter ruine. It was when approaching to the land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe they refuſed to enter there, giving more credit to the falſe reports raiſed by Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, then to the word of God, and the aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had ſo often given them of the goodneſs &amp; Excellency of that agreeable abode: This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked Gods wrath to that degree, that he ſwore that not any of all thoſe, who had been incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to his word, ſhould enter into the place of repoſe and reſt, the Land of Promiſe, which he had prepared for them.</p>
                  <p>The words, in which he expreſſeth himſelf, are very remarkable upon this Subject. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.21. <hi>As I live, all the Earth ſhall be fill'd with the Majeſty of the Lord: but all thoſe who have ſeen my Glory, and the worders I have done in Egypt, and in the Deſart, and who have already Tempted me T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Times, and have been Rebellious and Diſobedient to my Voice, ſhall never ſee the Land, which I have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd their Fathers with an Oath; and not one of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:38446:113"/>them, who have Murmur'd againſt my Promiſes ſhall ever Enter there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Menance was not like the former, with which he had threatned that People: For it was, accompliſh'd to a Tittle, and not one of them that Murmur'd entred there. They all dyed in the Deſert, where they continued near Forty years, and their Children had the Happineſs to poſſeſs it in their place.</p>
                  <p>From this paſſage we diſcover two things; the firſt the Method which God uſed with thoſe, who relapſed ſo often into their Former diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and who by their Faithleſs promiſes wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out his Patience: The Second how he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports himſelf towards Chriſtians, who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do little elſe, but abuſe his favours, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their Former Sins. For that, which he did to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is a Figure and a lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of that, which Chriſtians may expect.</p>
                  <p>This is the remark and Advertiſement of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> upon this ſame Subject, and upon this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; whoſe words deſerve to be related in this place, and ponder'd with Attention.</p>
                  <p>It is in the Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> Chapter, where he delivers himſelf in this manner, <hi>I would not that you ſhould be Ignorant Brethren, that all our Fathers,</hi> who are the Iſraelites, <hi>were under the Cloud, and all paſſed thro' the Red Sea, all in</hi> Moſes <hi>were Baptized in the Cloud and in the Sea, and did all Eat the ſame Spiritual Meat, and did all drink the ſame Spiritual Drink; for they drank of the Spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Chriſt.</hi> But all did not receive equal benefit from theſe Bleſſings, for <hi>with many of them God was not pleaſed; for they died in the Wilderneſs.</hi> Now
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:38446:114"/>all theſe things happen'd Literally to them, but by way of Figure in reſpect of us. This is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto us, as far as may be, what will befall us, and admoniſh or forewarn us, <hi>that we do not luſt after things, as they did. Nor Tempt</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with our perfidious infidelity, <hi>as ſome of them did. And all theſe things happen'd to them in Figure and are Written for our Inſtruction.</hi> Wherefore concludes this Divine Apoſtle, <hi>Let him who ſeems to himſelf to ſtand, take heed that he do not fall.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, that every one take great care to conſerve himſelf in the Grace of God, when once he hath had the bleſſing to receive it.</p>
                  <p>All this is more then enough to demonſtrate the truth, we have advanc'd, of the extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which our Salvation is expos'd by frequent relapſes into mortal ſin. But behold yet a more expreſs text of the ſame Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ch. 6.7. who ſpeaking to thoſe who fall back into Sin after they have been once reconcil'd to God, deſcribes what they may expect under the metaphor of an ungratefull Soil, which being carefully till'd however brings forth no fruit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Land</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which is water'd with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent rains, and which brings forth to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man its fruit in due ſeaſon receiveth Bleſſing of God. But if it bring not forth but only thorns, and bryars, it is given over to be accurs'd, and at the end to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by fire. Terra enim ſaepè venientem ſuper ſe bibens imbrem, &amp; generans her bam opportunam illis a qùibus colligitur, accipit benedictionem à Deo. Proferens au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſpinas ac tribulos, reproba eſt, &amp; meledicto proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, cujus conſumatio in combuſtionem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:38446:114"/>
                  <p>Theſe words have no need at all of explication, <hi>Theotime,</hi> but only of reflection; putting in ſtead of the word <hi>ungratefull Soil,</hi> that of <hi>a Soul unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and perfidious to her God;</hi> who by returning to her uſual Sins continually abuſes the graces ſhe receives in the Sacraments, without bringing forth any of the fruits of true repentance; And you will find that this is, what ſhe ought to fear from the hand of God, and what you your ſelf if you be ſuch, ought to ſtand in dread of, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt you be rejected by God, be curſed by him, and abandoned to eternal fire.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three miſeries, which are the greateſt of all thoſe which one can fear, are thoſe which make up and accompliſh the eternal damnation; and they are the very ſame expreſs'd in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which God ſhall pronounce againſt the damned. <hi>Go ye Accurſed into everlaſting fire.</hi> See what we have ſaid upon this ſubject in the ſecond part, the 11th Chapter, and third Article.</p>

                  <p>THere are other authorities we might bring, and a vaſt number of reaſons that evidently make out the extreme danger to which this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent relapſe into ſin after Confeſſion expoſeth the Salvation of thoſe, who do not at all amend. I will alledge ſome few in this place.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that the Salvation of thoſe who
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:38446:115"/>are in Mortal Sin depends upon true Penance, and a good Confeſſion; Now it is very difficult for thoſe, who live in this ordinary relapſe, to be truly Penitent, when they come to Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and by conſequence it is very hard for them not to make frequently invalid and null Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whereby they receive no Abſolution of their Sins.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, it is certain that thoſe, who live in this manner, do not ordinarily confeſs, but by courſe and cuſtom upon occaſion of ſome great Solemnity, or for ſome other reaſon of decency, and apparent piety: They ſeldom or never do it with a true Spirit of repentance, and a real deſire to amend, and break themſelves of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious habit. And by this means how many inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Confeſſions do they make?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how can it be thought, that thoſe, who relapſe ordinarily into the ſame Sins after their Confeſſions, ſhould have true Contrition, when they make their Confeſſions? For true Contrition requires a great, and that ſorrowfull, ſenſe of what is paſt, with a firm and conſtant reſolution for the time to come. Now who can believe, that they deteſt thoſe Sins from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their hearts, which they reſume again ſo eaſily and ſo ſoon? how can it be thought, that they have a firm reſolution to do, what they wellnigh never go about to do; that is, to amend their Lives? How can it be, that in all their Confeſſions they have a firm reſolution to leave the Sin, which yet they never forſake? or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaving it at all, can it be believ'd, that they have always a true reſolution to forſake it? This is what cannot be conceiv'd; and which never
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:38446:115"/>happens in Temporal concerns, where a firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution never ſcarcely but takes effect, and is follow'd with performance.</p>
                  <p>Certainly there is not any more infallible ſign of falſe Repentance. For as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſe poenitens es, poeniteat te; ſi poenitet te, noli facere; ſe adhuc facis, poenitens non es. If you are Penitent, you ought to repent your ſelf of your Sin; if you be ſorry for it, do not commit it; if yet you commit it, you are not penitent at all.</hi> And St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith excellently well, <hi>that he, who is aſham'd of the evil he hath done, will take great care to avoid, what may make him bluſh anew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some are wont to anſwer, that this relapſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin doth not proceed from any want of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and repentance, but from humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which inclines to evil.</p>
                  <p>This excuſe is as falſe and ill grounded, as it is common amongſt men, who flatter themſelves in their Sins, which they will not leave.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, can it be ſaid, that this is an effect of Frailty, when one willfully returns to Sin, knowing full well the evil he doth, and when he hath all the means neceſſary to preſerve himſelf from it? Is not this, what we call the Sin of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and not of Frailty? as we have ſhewn above in the Third Part, Chap. 14. And yet this is the caſe of the greateſt part of all thoſe, who relapſe ordinarily into Sin after Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Can it be call'd an effect of Frailty, when one returns to Sin, becauſe he will not take pains, or do any thing, which may withdraw him from it; he will not avoid the occaſions; nor remove the cauſes of it; nor take counſel; nor uſe any means to that effect? Is not this
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:38446:116"/>clearly to deceive ones ſelf, to treat in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and yet to attribute his frequent relapſe to Humane Frailty?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, However were not this frailty aſſiſted by divine grace, the excuſe might paſs: But being ſtrengthened as it is, abundantly by the helps, which God beſtows upon us in our neceſſities; we cannot lay the fault of our relapſes into Sin upon our own frailty, but we ſhall accuſe our ſelves, either of not demanding the grace of God in our prayert, or of not being faithfull in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating with his grace.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to ſpeak the truth, we ought not here to accuſe humane frailty, but the weakneſs of our repentance &amp; contrition; the faint regret or ſorrow for Sins paſt, and the weak and very imperfect reſolution we have to avoid them for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſay, that the relapſe into Sin is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an effect of a falſe repentance: for that is not true; and it is certain it may happen, and happens dayly that one falls back into thoſe Sins, of which he was truly penitent. But I ſpeak of a frequent, and ordinary relapſe; and I affirm, that morally ſpeaking, it is impoſſible, that thoſe who live in this manner, do not make very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently invalid and null Confeſſions, for want of contrition; and that they often believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be, when they are not, truly Penetent for the reaſons above-mention'd; which evinces the truth of that excellent ſaying of St. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, to demand frequently pardon for faults which one frequently commits, this is not to be a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, but only to have a ſhadow and appearance of Penance.</hi> Ponder well theſe words.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> An excellent Advertiſement of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> upon the falſe repentance of thoſe, who return to their Sins.</head>
                  <p>I Cannot omit in this place an advertiſement of main concern, which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great in his Paſtoral 3. p. c. 3. gives to thoſe, who after they have performed their Penances do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their lives; which is, that they ought to take heed leſt their repentance be not very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falſe and only in outward ſhew: Of which he gives a conſiderable reaſon in theſe words. <hi>We muſt admoniſh thoſe, who do Penance for their paſt Sins, and who nevertheleſs relapſe into them, that they carefully conſider one thing; which is, that many times it happens to Sinners, that they find within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves motions, which carry them on to Virtue, but unprofitably and without fruit; as it happens many times to the Juſt to be tempted and ſollicited to Sin, but without effect.</hi> He adds, that as the Temptations, to which the Juſt do not at all conſent, ſerve to confirm them more in Virtue; ſo theſe imperfect motions towards Virtue ſerve to detain the Sinners in their Sins, and to give them a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous conſidence of their Salvation in the midſt of their Sins, which they commit ſo freely without remorſe: And he obſerves, that this preſumption is a puniſhment of their reitersted and repeated Sins.</p>
                  <p>He produces conſequent to this diſcourſe two oppoſit examples of <hi>Balaam</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:38446:117"/>ſaith St. <hi>Gregory, ſeeing from the top of a Mountain the people of God encamp'd in the Deſart, conceived ſome pious and ſtrong deſires of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, languiſhing away in wiſhes to dye the death of the Juſt, and to reſemble that holy People in his death. But immediately after he gave pernicious Counſel to deſtroy thoſe very People, whom he had ſo much wiſhed to reſemble in his death. St.</hi> Paul <hi>on the contrary feels within himſelf the motions, which ſollicite him to Sin, and theſe Tomptations confirm him more in Virtue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence comes this St. <hi>Gregory</hi> asks the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? Balaam <hi>is touched with motions of repentance, and is not juſtified: St.</hi> Paul <hi>is incited to Sin, and the temptation doth not defile his Soul: But to convince us, that good works begun and not perfected, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce at all to the Salvation of the wicked, no more then the firſt motions to evil do render good and Virtuous Souls culpable in the ſight of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Animadverſion deſerves to be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and ſo much the more for that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks a very particular reaſon of the falſe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which is cuſtomary to thoſe, who do not at all amend then Lives; <hi>viz.</hi> that it often happens they have only a beginning of repentance by ſome good motions they ſeel in their heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proceeding further. They conceive indeed ſome diſple ſure againſt their Sins, but not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred and deteſtation of them; they feel ſome faint deſires, but they have not at all an entire and true reſolution to forſake them.</p>
                  <p>There is yet one thing more very remarkable in this Advertiſement upon the example of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> and his falſe repentance: For this wicked Prophet in the motion he had of repentance, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red indeed to dye the death of the Juſt; but he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:38446:117"/>ſaith not one word of living as they did; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the bleſſing to reſemble them in his death; but not to be like unto them in his life. <hi>Let my Soul,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.10. <hi>dye the death of the Juſt, and let my end be like unto theirs.</hi> Thus his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance was not true but falſe; becauſe he did not deſire to forſake his Sins, and amend his life; but only to be ſav'd at the hour of death. Which is properly to deſire to live ill, and yet dye well, and ſo not be puniſh'd for it. Now this kind of repentance is found but too often amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and peculiarly amongſt thoſe who live in this cuſtomary relapſe, of which we ſpeak. For there is not one ſingle man of them, who deſire not to dye in the grace of God, and ſave their Souls. And for this reaſon they go to Confeſſion now and then to diſcharge themſelves of their paſt Sins, that they may not be troubled with remorſe of Conſcience at the hour of death: But they ſeldom or never deſire to live holily; or at leaſt they have not an effectual and efficacious will to do it, as by their frequent relapſes it doth but too evidently appear.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That by returning back to Sin we loſe great part of the fruit of our precedent good Confeſſions.</head>
                  <p>THis is another efficacious reaſon to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the danger to which one expoſeth his Salvation by returning back to Sin. That it doth not only render abundance of Confeſſions invalid and nall; but it alſo makes us loſe the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:38446:118"/>fruit of thoſe good Confeſſions we have made.</p>
                  <p>Two fruits there are of the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The firſt is the Remiſſion of Sins. The ſecond the Recovery of the friendſhip of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and many other Graces and Aſſiſtances, which he grants by vertue of the Sacrament to thoſe, who perform the Penance their Sins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Tho' theſe two effects be produced at the ſame time, and inſeparably the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet one may be loſt without the other. For by relapſe into Mortal Sin one doth not at all loſe the Remiſſion, which he hath receiv'd of precedent Sins by good Confeſſions; it being moſt certain, that a Sin once pardon'd doth never revive again: Foraſmuch as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>The gifts of God are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> But as to the Friendſhip of God, and the ſpecial aſſiſtances of his Grace, which one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by means of the Sacrament, it is certain they are entirely loſt, when one relapſes into Mortal Sin: and this miſchievous fall cauſeth a deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ruine in his Soul, who yields himſelf over to it.</p>
                  <p>God himſelf threatens this by his Prophet. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3.20. <hi>If the Juſt Man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws himſelf from his Juſtice to return to his former iniquity, I will forget all the good, he hath done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Wiſe Man ſaith upon this Subject, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 34.30. <hi>What doth it avail a man, who hath touched a dead body to have waſhed himſelf, if again he defile himſelf and touch it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the reaſon, why God ſaith to Sinners by his Prophet; <hi>waſh and be cleanſed:</hi> he doth not only ſay that they waſh themſelves from their iniquities, but that they be alſo cleanſed; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:38446:118"/>as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves, <hi>it is to no purpoſe to be waſhed, if one do not conſerve himſelf clean.</hi> Without this one doth no more then thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Animals, which waſh themſelves, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently return to wallow in the dirt.</p>
                  <p>This obliged St. <hi>Peter</hi> and others, when they ſpoke of Penance to advertiſe Penitents, that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance avails them nothing, who, after they have performed it, return to Sin; except it be for their greater ruine. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Gregory</hi> above-cited, <hi>who do Penance, and do not amend their Lives, are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, that it is to no purpoſe to cleanſe themſelves from their Sins by tears; if afterwards by their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil actions they defile their Souls:</hi> And <hi>that they ſeem only to cleanſe themſelves, to the end that after they are waſhed they may return to their former filth.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> That by frequent relapſe into Sin one allways falls into a worſe condition, then before.</head>
                  <p>THis truth our Saviour himſelf hath taught us upon occaſion of a poſſeſſed perſon, whom he had delivered from that miſerable condition. It happens, ſaith he, that the wicked Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt out of a man, uſeth all his endeavours to return to his former dwelling, and calling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to his aſſiſtance at laſt he re-enters there, &amp; this ſecond poſſeſſion is much more prejudicial then the former. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.45. <hi>and the laſt of that man be made worſe then the firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this example of a perſon whoſe body is
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:38446:119"/>poſſeſſed, we are inſtructed in what paſſes in the Soul, when one unfortunatly relapſes into Sin; as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath explained it in theſe words, 2. <hi>Epiſtle</hi> cited in the ſecond Chapter. <hi>If after they are retired from the diſorders of the world they ſuffer themſelves yet to be intangled and overcome: thereby they fall back into a worſe condition then before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if this be true of the firſt relpſe, what will it be of the Second, of the Tenth, of the Twentieth, and of all thoſe, which befall them, who do nothing elſe all their life time, but riſe and fall, repent and then as often return to the Sins they had repented of? It is evident that they fall at laſt into a moſt deplorable State, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven almoſt into an impoſſibility ever to ſave their Souls.</p>
                  <p>This is certain, and if you doubt it; anſwer if you can, this proof and demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>By this ordinary relapſe, three things which put his Salvation in the utmoſt danger, befall the Sinner. Firſt, ill habits encreaſe, and grow ſtronger and ſtronger. <hi>2ly.</hi> The light and graces of God diminiſh in an high degree. <hi>3ly.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil comes with more ſtrength, and power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, whom he ſees ſo deeply engaged in wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Behold three things, which without doubt when they happen, endanger Salvation in an high degree: Now it is certain they befall all thoſe, who frequently return to Sin.</p>
                  <p>For firſt as to vicious habits; it cannot be doubted but they are ſo fortifi'd by frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, that they become at length invincible. The reaſon is clear, and the experience but too certain; as was evidently ſhewn in the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:38446:119"/>of Youth in the firſt part. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>As to the Graces, or ſpecial favours of God, there is not any thing more apt to diminiſh them then cuſtomary relapſes accompanied with ſuch and ſo many Ingratitudes, perfidious Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and contempts, as have been above declar'd. But that which moſt of all impairs them, is the abuſe of the Sacraments, which one is guilty of during theſe frequent relapſes. For of two, the one, either the Confeſsions which they make, and the Communions they frequent, are good or bad: if had; then they are ſo many Sacriledges; which provoke Gods wrath againſt us, which baniſh his grace from our Souls, and render us infinitely unworthy in his ſight. If good; then they are ſo many benefits, and divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which by relapſe into Sin, are render'd uſeleſs, nay moſt miſerably trampled under our feet. What? are ſo many divine favours, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny illuminations, good thoughts, and pious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which one had received in the Sacrament, ſlighted and loſt by one relapſe? No queſtion but they are: How can it then be, but that thoſe caſt away and neglected favours ſhould be the cauſe of the loſs of many others, according to that Sentence of our Saviour. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.12. <hi>He that hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall abound: but he that hath not, from him ſhall be taken away, that alſo which he hath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if the divine graces and favours be loſt and diminiſhed by theſe ordinary relapſes, the third effect, which is the encreaſe of the ſtrength of our Ghoſtly enemy, muſt follow of neceſsity. For as God is no ſooner departed from the Soul, but the Devil preſently takes poſſeſsion of it; ſo
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:38446:120"/>alſo, according to the meaſure of his removal, the Devil becomes more powerfull to deſtroy us. This is a neceſſary and infallible conſequence; and this is the reaſon, why God pronounced this Dreadfull Sentence, Oſea. 9.12. <hi>Wo be to them, when I ſhall depart from them.</hi> Well knowing that nothing but miſeries and misfortunes could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, whom he had forſaken. And the greateſt of theſe misfortuues is, that the Devil becomes maſter of the Soul, and reduces her to ſuch a ſlavery, as to oblige her to do his will, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath it 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>by whom they are kept captives at his will or beck.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> That frequent relapſe into Sin leads to final Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, and an evil death, or to dye in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin.</head>
                  <p>THis Propoſition is the reſult of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and more immediately follows from the three laſt; for if this cuſtomary return to Sin be the cauſe of a great number of ill confeſsions, and deprive us of the fruit of thoſe we had made well: if in the way of Salvation it make a man always fall from bad to worſe; it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it leads to the broad way of Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and that it may often come to paſs, that thoſe who live in this ordinary relapſe, end their lives in mortal Sin.</p>
                  <p>And I would to God this Propoſition were not ſo abſolutely true, as indeed it is; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the former reaſons, behold yet others, which put it out of doubt.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:38446:120"/>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe thoſe, who live in theſe cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry relapſes intermingled with Confeſsions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves to be in a good way, whereas in reality they are far from it. They rely much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the confeſsions, which they make from time to time, and never conſider how faulty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient their relapſes make them in the ſight of God. Hence it befalls them, what S. <hi>Gregory</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, cap. 31. ſpeaks of. <hi>That performing lamely ſome good works, which they begin, but do not perfect; they live in a proud preſumption, that they ſhall be ſaved in the midſt of the evils which they commit, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, to the full;</hi> hence it is, that not at all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting their wicked ſtate, they dye without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of their Sins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe being often ſubject to make falſe Confeſſions, they are in great danger leſt the laſt they make be like the former: and that in this laſt important occaſion, they ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to have true Contrition, when they have but a falſe one, &amp; what is apparent only, as they had in many precedent Confeſſions. This happens very eaſily, eſpecially if at that laſt time they confeſs themſelves to their accuſtomed Ghoſtly father, who hath entertain'd them in their ordinary relapſes, and cheriſhed them in their perpetuall impenitences.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by reaſon that thoſe who live in theſe relapſes, intermixed with admittance to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, become obdurate to all things which might move them, hardened againſt all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which one can offer them, of Fear, of Hope, of the love of God. They are accuſtomed to hear all theſe things in their Confeſſions, and elſwhere, This makes them, that they are not moved at all,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:38446:121"/>when ſuch motives are offer'd to them in the moſt preſſing occaſions: Becauſe whatſoever is familiar to us, makes no impreſſion upon us. <hi>Ab aſſuetis non fit paſſio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, the laſt reaſon is, that thoſe who live in this manner have great grounds to fear, that God will forſake them at that laſt hour, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their repeated Infidelities, of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes which they have offered to the Sacraments, and divine graces which they have therein received; and alſo in chaſtiſement of a tacit preſumption they have had of themſelves, that they were able to raiſe themſelves from ſin, whenſoe're they pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>A preſumption however common, yet highly offenſive in the ſight of God; and ſo much the more for that it is the cauſe of all the relapſes one falls into after confeſſion. Becauſe they believe they ſhall always riſe again well, as hitherto they have done, therefore they are ſo far from being affraid to offend again, that hence they take occaſion to ſin more freely; but it frequently falls out that they find themſelves deceived; and that God by a juſt judgment pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them at the hour of their death, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking them and leaving them then to themſelves in their greateſt need, who before had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abuſed his graces; and yet were ſo raſh and confident, as to account themſelves ſecure.</p>
                  <p>the Hiſtory of <hi>Sampſon</hi> is very remarkable upon this Subject. God had endowed him with an extraordinary and miraculous ſtrength of body: he employ'd it many times againſt the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> his Enemies, whom he had often overthrown and put to flight; and particularly upon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:38446:121"/>wherein his Wife, who was of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuppoſing ſhe had got out of him the ſecret of his ſtrength, had attempted to deliver him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands; He had dicomfited them with much eaſe: and upon this confidence he comes to tell her, that the ſecret of his Strength lay in his Hair, not believing perhaps that what he ſaid was true. She called his Enemies to fall upon him, and after ſhe had cut off his hair, whilſt he was aſleep, ſhe delivered him over into their hands. He awakes with the noiſe, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remarks that awakening he ſaid; <hi>Egrediar ſicut ante feci &amp; excutiam me,</hi> Jud. 16.20. <hi>I will go out, as I have done, and I will diſengage my ſelf as heretofore:</hi> but it adds that he was deceived in his hopes; <hi>neſciens quod receſſiſſet ab eo Dominus, not knowing,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>that God had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned him.</hi> In conſequence whereof, he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of his Enemies, who pull out his eyes and ſend him into their Country, where he, who but a while before was a terrour to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is now become their paſtime and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their ſcorn.</p>
                  <p>Behold a figure and lively repreſentation of what befalls Chriſtian Souls, who abuſe the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, and allways return unto their Sins, in hopes to clear themſelves of them, as they have done heretofore; for God many times gives them over to an obdurate heart, and to final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence; whether it be in denying them time to do Penance, or in depriving them of the means and grace to perform it well: ſince that, as St <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Altho' he hath promiſed pardon to peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners, he hath not promiſed Penance to any one. Qui poenitenti veniam promiſit, nulli promiſit poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:38446:122"/>a truth not to be doubted of, and which deſerves to be well conſidered, to teach men not to preſume or conſide too much in the divine Mercies, and not render themſelves unworthy of them at the hour of death; wherein as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſaid, he will ſcorn thoſe, who have deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Counſels, and neglected the admonitions he gave them to return unto him. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I call'd, and you refuſed, I ſtretched out my hand and there was none that regarded: You have deſpiſed all my Counſels, and ſlighted my reprehenſions. I alſo will laugh at your deſtruction; and will ſcorn when that ſhall come unto you, which you feared.</hi> Prov. 1.24.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the remedies againſt the relapſe into Sin.</head>
                  <p>I Should not eaſily make an end, if I ſhould write all which offers it ſelf to be ſaid upon this Subject. But it is time to ſpeak of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and after you have ſeen the greatneſs of the evil, to ſhew you the way to cure what's paſt, and for the future to avoid the like.</p>
                  <p>We cannot better find them out then by ſearching for them in the reſemblance they bear to Corporal Infirmities, and from the proportion they have to thoſe remedies, which are neceſſary to avoid relapſes, which are oftentimes more dangerous then the firſt Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, as in Corporal Diſtempers the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies depend upon two Perſons, the Phyſitian, who preſcribes them, and the Patient who takes them for his Cure; the ſame is to be underſtood
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:38446:122"/>of the Infirmities of the Soul, which depend partly upon the Confeſſors, who are the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and partly upon the Penitent, who muſt labour to ſave his Soul. This is what obliges us to ſpeak ſomething here of what both the one and the other are bound to contribute on their part; and to treat in this Chapter of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Confeſſors.</p>
                  <p>Now as in Corporal Sickneſs the relapſes may ſpring from the Phyſitians fault; either becauſe he hath not ſufficient Skill to know the proper Remedies of that Diſtemper; or prudence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to apply them in due ſeaſon; or ſufficient reſolution and conſtancy, notwithſtanding his reſiſtance or impatience, to make them be put in execution by the Patient: So when Penitents ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily relapſe into their Sins, one may often truly ſay, that it proceeds from the Confeſſor's fault, who is deficient in one of theſe three things; either not having ſufficient knowledge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſorder, or of the remedies it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; or wanting Prudence to apply them right; or at leaſt (which is moſt ordinary) not reſolution enough to oblige the Penitents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to when they appear, as but too often they do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing: A reſolution, which is an effect of Charity, which they ought to have, towards their Penitents, whoſe Salvation they ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeek after, then accommodate themſelves to their inclinations, when they are contrary to their good.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain that were Confeſſors ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently endowed with theſe three qualities, and uſed them well, as they are obliged to do, they would prevent a vaſt number of relapſes; and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:38446:123"/>put their Penitents into the way of a truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, their Skill giving them a perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the obligation which Chriſtians have to live in the grace of God, and of the danger to which by theſe relapſes their Salvation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, they would make a more ſtrict enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt proper means to cure their Penitents of their Vices.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their Prudence would make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive to underſtand the preſent State of the Penitent; in which they ought eſpecially to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two things. 1. Whether he be in a State ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receive Abſolution; and, 2ly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any hopes of his amendment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by their reſolution they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Penitent to perform what they ſhall judge neceſſary for theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> To receive the Sacrament as he ought; and thereby to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Confeſſor then, as a good Phyſitian of Souls, is obliged to have theſe three qualities; and to employ them for the good of his Penitent, and the better diſcharge of his own Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>This good of the Penitent conſiſts in two things. Firſt, that he be reſtored to health, that is, to the grace of God. Secondly, that he do not relapſe into his former Sickneſs, Mortall Sin. For as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> obſerves well in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>there are two parts in Phyſick; the one to cure the Diſeaſe; the other to conſerve the health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Confeſſor is obliged to procure both theſe goods for the Penitent, and to employ for that end all what lies in his power, his knowledge, his prudence, and his charitable Reſolution. He
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:38446:123"/>muſt not content himſelf to have reſtored his Penitent to health; but he muſt labour alſo to conſerve it; if he deſign to comply with the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a worthy Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and a true Cooperatour with the Grace of God; which as the ſame St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> adds, <hi>ibid. Si ergo Deus medicinam exhibet, quâ ſanemur infirmi, quanto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis eam, quâ cuſtodiamur ſani,</hi> doth not ſatisfy himſelf to remit our Sins by juſtification, but moreover grants the aſſiſtance of his Grace to conſerve us in that happy ſtate. That he may make him pertaker of the former good, he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to examin ſtrictly whether the Penitent be capable of Abſolution, and to this end it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to examine two things. The one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he have any of the impediments above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the 4th Part, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. and the other whether it be uſuall for him to return to his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sins after confeſſion. For in this caſe, there is no reaſon why you ſhould eaſily believe the Penitent, tho' he tells you that he is truly ſorry that he hath offended God, and promiſes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend: He often indeed ſpeaks theſe words, but they come not from his heart. Or if they proceed from a ſenſe of his Sins, it is but lightly, and by way of habit, without having ſeriouſly thought of his amendment. He believes he hath contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but hath it not. This is what happens fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and then the Confeſſor cannot give ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, without putting himſelf in danger to commit a Secrilege. He ought to defer it, and give time to his Penitent, to think as he ought, of his amendment, and render, himſelf a ſubject worthy of Abſolution.</p>
                  <p>This procedure ſurpriſes the Penitents, when
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:38446:124"/>they find the Confeſſors treat them, as they are obliged to do; but theſe are in name only and not Penitents in effect; who believe that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion conſiſts only in a declaration of their Sins, and that when once they have declared them, they have a right to receive Abſolution, and to oblige the Confeſſor to it. They will be believed upon their ſingle word, when they ſay they are truly ſorry for their Sins, and that they will not commit them any more for the future: although in their former Confeſſions they have always ſaid the ſame, and without effect.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Penitents moſt groſsly deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: For they will judge their judges, and teach their Phyſitians. It belongs to the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to judg of the ſtate of the Penitent, and ſee whether he be ſufficiently diſpoſed to receive ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and whether or no he can ſecurely give it. This care is his duty, as being oliged to give an account of this his function in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Almighty God. It is the Bloud of the Son of God, which he applys in the Sacrament; and God will require an exact and rigourous account of him, if he did diſtribute it to thoſe that are unworthy of it.</p>
                  <p>Now judge <hi>Theotime,</hi> whether the Penitent be not very unreaſonable, who would oblige his Confeſſor to give him Abſolution, when he the Confeſſor either doth not find him at all duly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or hath good grounds to doubt whether he be worthy of it. Is not this to go about to damn himſelf and his Confeſſor too?</p>
                  <p>But if the Penitent be blamable in this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Confeſſor is much more in fault, when he yields ſo eaſily to the importunities of his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:38446:124"/>as to give him a doubtfull abſolution; and which may be rather hurtfull then profitable to him. He ought to remember, that there are ſome cruel mercies, hurtfull both to thoſe to whom they are ſhewn, and to thoſe, who ſhew them; and that the good Phyſitian doth not deſiſt from applying his remedies, when he judges them neceſſary, notwithſtanding all the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his Patient makes. He lets him cry out and complain, being aſſured that what he does is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Patient; who when he ſhall have recovered his health will not only be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to have ſuffered, but alſo acknowledge the kindneſs his Phyſitian did him.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays excellently well upon this Subject, <hi>Epiſt. ad Vincent. He is not always a Friend, who ſpares or is favourable to us; nor he always an Enemy, who chaſtizeth; the Phyſitian, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a Lunatick to be bound, and awakes one in a Lethargy, is troubleſome to them both; but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loves them, and by tormenting them he cures them. The one and the other, as long as they are ſick, are angry with him; but as ſoon as they are cured, they hold themſelves much obliged to him for that he did not ſpare them. Ambobus moleſtus, ambos amat, ambos ſanat. Ambo quamdiu aegri ſunt indignantur. ſed ambo ſani gratulantur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, that a Confeſſor ought ſo to employ his Reſolution, as not to forget his ſweet and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging mildneſs, but, that he ought, as much as poſſible, to make the Penitent approve of what he ordains, ſweetening all things by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his affection; and convincing him, that what he adviſes is to acquit himſelf of his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the Salvation of his Soul. This is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:38446:125"/>the Oyle of the Goſpel, <hi>Luc.</hi> 34. which he muſt employ with the Wine, when he dreſſes the wounds of others Conſciences, endeavouring by Charity to ſweeten the ſharpeſt remedies which he is obliged to uſe therein.</p>
                  <p>Behold here the firſt good, which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor ought to have in view, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſecure the Sacrament, and to reſtore the Penitent to the grace of God. But yet there is a ſecond which he is obliged alſo, as far as he is able, to procure, <hi>viz.</hi> the amendment of the Penitent. The Cure is good for nothing, which is followed by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, and the Phyſitian who is not concerned to prevent it, complies but with half his duty; and becomes himſelf guilty of the harm into which the ſick man falls again, and even of death it ſelf if it befall him.</p>
                  <p>This is the reaſon why the Confeſſor is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not only to advertiſe the Penitent not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Sins; but alſo to ſhew him the means how to avoid them, and to engage him to put them in execution.</p>
                  <p>Theſe means are Penance, Prayer, ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Works, as Faſting, Alms-deeds, Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and others which we have handled above in the Fourth Part, and whereof we ſhall yet ſpeak in the following Chapter.</p>
                  <p>To which may be added certain conditional Penances, that is ſome painfull things to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or ſuffered by the Penitent in caſe he return again unto his Sins; and as often, as he ſhall relapſe therein: as to Faſt, to give Alms, or ſome other painfull work for each relapſe. The apprehenſions of theſe ſort of Puniſhments ſerve frequently, as a Bridle to with-hold the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:38446:125"/>Penitents, when they are tempted to offend God. And laſtly, the deferring of Abſolution, when the Penitent doth not at all correct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is frequently a very good remedy to make him amend his Life. This makes the Penitent think ſeriouſly of amendment, and labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Vices, which make him unworthy of ſo great a good, and punctually to comply with all that he the Confeſſor ſhall ordain him, to the end he may be worthy.</p>
                  <p>This means ought to be applied with much Prudence; and eſpecially it behoveth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor to make a vaſt diſtinction between Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, who relapſe into their Sins through frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and thoſe who return through malice, that is to ſay, either on ſet purpoſe, or through an affected negligence.</p>
                  <p>He will know the former, when he ſhall find, that they are extreamly troubled to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſubject to thoſe relapſes: that they uſe all their endeavours to abſtain from Sin: that they practice what means their Confeſſor appoints them. And towards theſe he muſt uſe a far greater ſweetneſs, ſupport their weakneſs, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them more eaſily, ſeeing they continue to labour on their part to amend their Lives.</p>
                  <p>The latter are thoſe, who not only continue in their wickedneſs; but do either nothing at all, or very little to refrain from their Sins. And towards theſe one muſt uſe more ſeverity: And as they allways promiſe to endeavour their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, without doing almoſt any thing, it is often not only profitable, but neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer their Abſolution, untill ſuch time as they have given ſufficient ſigns of their Converſion by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:38446:126"/>from their Sins, and practiſing faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully what is appointed them for that end.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the means which Penitents ought to obſerve to avoid the relapſe into Sin.</head>
                  <p>COntinuing the compariſon of a Penitent with a ſick perſon, I affirm, that there are four things which the Penitent ought to obſerve that he may not relapſe in mortal Sin.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that he underſtand perfectly the greatneſs of his evil, and the eminent danger to which he expoſes his Salvation: For the Sick man who hath no apprehenſion of the ill conſequences of his diſeaſe ſhall never be cured: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be fully convinc'd of two things: firſt, that to fall into mortal Sin, of all misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes is the greateſt. Secondly, that the relapſe into ſin expoſes the eternall ſalvation to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hazard; and that one finds himſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, when he leaſt thinks of it.</p>
                  <p>The next thing he ought to do in conſequence to this knowlege, is to avoid all thoſe things which have been the cauſes of this misfortune, or which may make it return. This is an indiſpenſable obligation; this is alſo the firſt mark of a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Soul and deſirous to recover her former health. We laugh at a ſick man, that will not abſtain from ſuch meats, or actions, as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended prejudiciall to him: we ſay, that he loves his pleaſures more then his health, and that he is his own murderer. The like is to be ſaid
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:38446:126"/>of a Penitent, when he doth the ſame. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22. <hi>How long will Fools deſire, what is hurtfull to them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is, the choice of a good Phyſitian: that is, he muſt always addreſs himſelf to the beſt Confeſſors, to thoſe whom he believes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the three above-mentioned quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and above all to thoſe who are not in the leaſt neglective of the recovery of their Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, but apply themſelves ſeriouſly and with much care to that effect. The Penitent who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires his health, muſt ſeek out ſuch Phyſitians. If he do not it is an infallible proof that he doth not deſire to amend. He is afraid leſt the Confeſſor ſhould make him ſenſible of his miſery, and put a ſtop to the diſorders of his Conſcience: a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign that he is not willing to be cured. Do not you do thus <hi>Theotime,</hi> remember that excellent ſentence of St. <hi>Auguſtin, Non timet reprehenſorem, qui veritatem amat; He that loves truth,</hi> that is his Salvation, <hi>is not afraid of a monitor,</hi> or to have his defects laid open before his Eyes.</p>
                  <p>The 4th is, faithfully to apply the remedies, which are neceſſary to cure the Soul &amp; preſerve it from Sin: whether they be thoſe, which the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian preſcribes, or thoſe which by other ways one comes to know. None doubts but that this way is abſolutely neceſſary: yet few practiſe it ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, as they believe it. Many Penitents there are, who could wiſh to amend their lives, but would do it at their eaſe without pain or trouble. The ſight of the remedies is a trouble to them; and when they ſhould put them in execution, their heart fails them, and they will do nothing at all. Is not this to deſire an impoſſible thing, to ſeek the end without the means to obtain it, the cure
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:38446:127"/>without the remedies, and Salvation without trouble? This is to act like the <hi>slothfull man</hi> who <hi>will and yet will not:</hi> Prov. 13.4. This is a faint and imperfect wiſh to be deliver'd from their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, but in reality it is an effectual deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them, and never to be cured.</p>
                  <p>You will do otherwiſe, <hi>Theotime,</hi> if you are truly Penitent, and deſirous of your Salvation. You will with much care ſeek after the remedies againſt your Sins, and apply them with no leſs exactneſs. Behold here ſome few.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, that you have a ſpecial care to conſerve in your Soul the Spirit of Penance, which you were made partaker of in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> an Hatred of Sin, a Sorrow to have Committed it, and a Reſolution to offend no more. Now to conſerve this ſpirit it is neceſſary you renew theſe acts every day: which may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done.</p>
                  <p>The Second is to perform with this Spirit the works of Penance, as well thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the Sacrament, as others which you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon your ſelf. Theſe works as the Council of. <hi>Trent</hi> declares, conduce very much to divert and deter us from our Sins.</p>
                  <p>The Third remedy is Prayer, For as all our ſtrength is from God, it is but juſt we make our addreſſes to him, that he will vouchſafe to aſſiſt us powerfully with his grace. This is a means abſolutely neceſſary, without which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to cure the diſtempers of the Soul. <hi>Ask,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.9. <hi>and you ſhall receive,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, what you do not demand, you ſhall not receive at all. But as this means is neceſſary, ſo alſo it is moſt powerfull, and never
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:38446:127"/>fails of its effect: According to that Sentence of the wiſe man, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 2.11. <hi>No one hath ever hoped in God, who hath been Confounded,</hi> or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of his deſires. But this Prayer muſt be frequent, and ſerverous, as we have need every day, ſo alſo <hi>we muſt always pray.</hi> Luc. 18. And as we beſeech him to vouchſafe his mercies that we may be ſav'd; ſo it is but juſt that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them with a great and ardent deſire, to the end we may be worthy of them.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth remedy is frequent Confeſſion. This alſo is a neceſſary means, without which it is morally impoſſible to be freed from a vicious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, when once one is engaged therein. It is a Sacrament which remits ſins paſt; which gives grace to avoid them for the future: There one renews his ſorrow for having offended God, and his reſolution thence-forward to be faithfull to him; one there receives advices, and means to that effect; one is thereby reduced into the path, who had loſt his way, encouraged when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, and fortified againſt the difficulties which occur. They who neglect this means, will never be freed from their habitual Sins; but thoſe who thirſt after their Salvation will embrace it with much affection. It is very convenient we make them often, and ordinarily ſpeaking to the ſame ſelect Confeſſor, and who is endowed with the qualities above-mention'd.</p>
                  <p>The holy Communion is alſo a very efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous remedy againſt relapſes. It gives ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt temptations: It weakens our ill habits: it makes us avoid many venial Sins, which lead and diſpoſe to mortal. But this is to be underſtood, when the Communion is performed with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:38446:128"/>diſpoſitions; and it produceth all theſe effects proportionably to the greater or leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion with which we approach that holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Be very diligent and carefull, <hi>Theotime,</hi> in the uſe and application of this divine remedy; and to that end reade that which hereafter we ſhall ſay of it.</p>
                  <p>The reading alſo of good Books is a moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull means to conſerve and keep us in the ſtraight path of virtue. We treated of this in the <hi>Inſtruction of Youth.</hi> 2d. <hi>Part. Chap.</hi> 16. which I exhort you to read once more upon this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>All theſe are general remedies and common to all ſort of Sins. There are others more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar againſt each Sin conſidered in its kind, which it would be too long to declare in this place; as alſo it would be uſeleſs, ſince we have treated of them elſewhere: as for example, the remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt idleneſs in the 3d. <hi>Part. Chap.</hi> 7, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt impurity in the 8th and 9th <hi>Chap.</hi> and in all the 4th. <hi>Part.</hi> Where we have treated of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian virtues, and the means to reſiſt contrary vices.</p>

               <hi>A Table of SINS, Or,</hi> An Examen of Conſcience upon the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God's Law, and of the Church; and upon the Seven Deadly Sins.</head>
            <p>Sin being a tranſgreſſion againſt the law of God, it follows, that to underſtand well in what one hath ſinn'd, he muſt know firſt what it is that God Commands, &amp; what that he forbids; and to examin his Conſcience rightly, it is neceſſary he run over the Commandments of God, as they ſtand in order, and ſee whether and how many ways he hath tranſgreſs'd them; for we offend God diverſe ways.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon why I ſhall digeſt here the ten Commandments of Gods Law, with all the ſins that may be committed againſt each one of them, that thence you may take what may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you. And for the greater facility, I have for my diverſion drawn up into Latin verſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral obligations, which each Commandment imports, with the tranſgreſſions oppoſed againſt them. I offer them to thoſe, who underſtand, and like them; others may benefit themſelves by the following explication.</p>

               <p>THis Commandment includes the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many virtues. <hi>viz.</hi> of Faith, of Hope, of Charity, of Religion, and of the care of our Salvation. It obligeth us to believe in God, to hope in him, to love him above all things, give him the worſhip and honour due to him, and to ſeek after the Salvation of our Soul, which he hath created to his own image and likeneſs, to enjoy him for all eternity. All theſe things are comprized in theſe three verſes.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſin againſt Faith is that of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; when one is ignorant of what he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to know.</p>
               <p>To be ignorant of the four principall My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries without the expreſs belief whereof we cannot be ſaved. <hi>viz.</hi> the Unity of one God, the Trinity of Perſons, the Incarnation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon for the Redemption of mankind, and life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>To be ignorant of the Apoſtles Creed: or not to know the ſenſe and meaning of it, as far as ones capacity, and the means he hath to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed will permit.</p>
               <p>To be ignorant of the Sacraments, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of thoſe which one either hath, or ought to receive.</p>
               <p>Not to know the Comandments of God, and the Church.</p>
               <p>All theſe ignorances ordinarily ſpeaking are mortal Sins: wherefore one ought carefully to examin himſelf, and reflect well whether he hath ſought the means to be inſtructed, as Catechiſms,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:38446:130"/>Sermons, reading and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second Sin againſt Faith is, a doubt of the truth of any of the points of Faith. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſometimes againſt our will, and then it is either none, or at leaſt not a Mortall Sin, but perhaps ſome venial negligence.</p>
               <p>But if it be voluntary, it is a Mortall Sin, and this in two caſes. 1ſt. When one either ſeeks it, or willingly gives ſome occaſion of it; as by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill Books, by diſcourſing too freely concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of faith: by examining them with too much curioſity: by giving himſelf too much liberty to judg of them according to humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 2ly. This doubt is voluntary, when one willingly detains himſelf in it, and gives his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Third is the Sin of Error, that is when from a doubt one proceeds to affirm, and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively believe ſomething contrary to the receiv'd Doctrine of the Church, altho' it be but in one ſingle article: and ſuch a belief is always a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin: and if one maintain it obſtinately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubmitting himſelf to the Church it is Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, whereof we are going about to ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fourth Sin is Hereſy. That is an error in any point of faith; maintain'd with obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; wherein one follows his own judgment in oppoſition to that of the Church; and chooſeth in points of Religion the things, which he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe or to deny, whence it is called He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, that is to ſay, a choice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Fifth is Impiety, which is different from hereſy in this, that Hereſy will believe ſome truths, but not all. But Impiety denys all, and believes nothing.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:38446:130"/>
               <p>You ought, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to examin your ſelf very ſtrictly, whether you have fallen into any of theſe Sins; and if you have, perform yet ſome more ſtrict and ſeverer Penance. But above all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate your thoughts, with ſome learned and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon; who may reſtore you to your ſelf, and put you in the right way.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth Sin againſt Faith, is to favour He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, or Impious men, as in ſupporting and approving what they do.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Seventh is to be pleaſed with their Company and diſcourſe: to continue therein with danger of embracing their opinions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Eighth is to read their Books, whether with pleaſure or danger.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Ninth is the Sin of Curioſity, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the Miſteries of Faith, or the Secrets of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, by pure humane reaſon, which leads ordinarily either to errour, or Impiety.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Tenth is to ſcoff at holy things, the ceremonies of the Church; to contemn them in his heart, or by any action whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Eleventh to abuſe the words of the holy Scripture, in applying them to wicked or prophane ſenſes, making them ſerve for jeſts, or other ill uſes.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Twelfth is, to deſire to know ſuch things to come, as appertain to God alone, or thoſe which are either paſt or preſent, but totally hidden from us: and for this end to employ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull means, as Soothſayers, Magicians, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-tellers, obſerve Omens, caſt Lotts, or make uſe of other Superſtitious Inventions.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The thirteenth is, to give credit to Dreams and Superſtitions, to employ Prayers
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:38446:131"/>or Sacred Names to ill uſes; to uſe Charms, or other Inventions to the end to make ones ſelf beloved, to cure Diſeaſes, or to give a Spell whether to Men, or Beaſts. All theſe are Mortal Sins; even when the means ſeem innocent, as Prayers, or Sacred words; if one believe they will certainly take effect: For then, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>De medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. animae contra ſortileg. Theſe are not remedies gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>but rather Poyſon, which the Devil hath ſpread amongſt holy things. Non eſt in eis remedium Chriſti, ſed venenum Diaboli.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. When one diſtruſts in the mercies of God, or deſpairs to be ever able to obtain of God the remiſſion of his Sins, as it happened to <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When one deſpairs of amending ones Life, and in this Deſpair abandons himſelf to all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs; which is a miſtruſt or contempt of the grace of God. This Sin is but too common.</p>
               <p n="2">II. One ſins by Preſumption.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When one hopes that God will allways for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give his Sins, whatſoever life he leads: and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in this hope he doth not at all concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to mend his Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When one defers his converſion 'till the end of his life, or puts off his Repentance 'till the honr of Death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When one willingly expoſes himſelf to any danger of offending God; as to Company, Reading, or any other thing by which he runs the hazard to offend. This is what we call to tempt God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When without neceſſity one expoſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſome Corporal danger, as Sickneſs, Wounds, or Death.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When in theſe ſo remarkable dangers of Body or Soul, one neglects his application and recourſe to God by Prayer to implore his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When in theſe ſame dangers one neglects the remedies, which God hath inſtituted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:38446:132"/>as thoſe of Phyſick for the Body; and thoſe of Prayer and Sacraments for the Soul.</p>
               <p>One ſins alſo againſt this Virtue in adverſities, when he is diſcouraged to that degree that he puts not his truſt in God; and more ſtill, when one is impatient, or murmures againſt his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in Adverſity, or is exalted in his own thoughts in time of Proſperity, attributing the good ſucceſs or Honour to himſelf.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>CHarity is a <hi>Theological Virtue,</hi> which makes us to love God above all things; whence it follows, that every Mortal Sin is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to it &amp; totally deſtroys it; Becauſe the Sinner, in every ſuch Sin prefers the affection he bears to the thing wherein he offends before the love and bounden duty he owes to God, who forbids the Sin.

                  <p>The greateſt ſin againſt Charity is the hatred of God. This is a Sin the very thought whereof cauſes an horrour in the Soul, and it is proper to the Devils and damned Souls. Yet however, ſometimes it is found amongſt men, when a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience oppreſs'd with misfortunes gives it ſelf over to complaints againſt God, as if he were the cauſe of them: to execrations, to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemys, and in fine to hate him whom he believes to be the cauſe of his miſeries, or from whom he fears the puniſhment of his crimes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, not to bear God the love, which he requires at our hands, that is, the love above all things, as he is the greateſt and moſt amiable of all goods. This happens when one is ſo diſpoſed in mind, that he will rather chooſe willfully to offend God, then looſe either ſome Honour, Riches, or life it ſelf, if it were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. This Sin is but too common, and one does not take notice of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is, to prefer the love of men
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:38446:133"/>before the love of God, to be more fearfull of their diſpleaſure; then of the offence of God; which he is, who offends God for fear of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men, or for fear leſt he be jeer'd, or ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet more when one offends God to pleaſe men. Examin your Conſcience well, whether you are free from all theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth is, to abſtain either for ſhame, or ſome other temporal reſpect, from doing the good, which is commanded us, or committing the evill, which is forbidden us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth is, to think ſeldom of God; to be aſhamed to ſpeak of him, as frequently it falls out: not to hearken to his Inſpirations: to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his benefits; to neglect to give him thanks. Examin your ſelf upon every one of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars one after another; for you will find that you have ſinned oftener, &amp; more greivouſly, then you imagin.</p>

                  <head>The Sins againſt the Virtue of Religion.</head>
                  <p>IT is a virtue, which teaches us to render to God the Worſhip and Honour, which is his due, and which conſiſts principally in three things. Adoration, Prayer, and Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>By Adoration we acknowledge him for the firſt and Soveraign Author of all things, and of us our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>By Prayer we teſtify the neceſſity, we have of him.</p>
                  <p>And by Sacrifice we acknowledge this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign dominion, which he hath over all creatures, and our abſolute dependence. Now there are
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:38446:133"/>many ſins againſt theſe three actions, which we ſhall relate in order in the following verſes.</p>
                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt, is not to adore God, or but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. This Sin is greater then one thinks, and deſerves to be particularly examined.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, not to adore him right, that is to worſhip him with the body, and not with the heart, which is indeed no adoration at all: for adoration is an acknowledgment which we make of the greatneſs of God, and of our depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is, either not at all, or very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to pray. This omiſſion, when frequent, may be a mortall Sin; becauſe of the command we have to pray, and of the neceſſity we have of Prayer.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:38446:134"/>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth is, to pray without attention, praying with our lips, and almoſt nothing with the heart: which is as much as not to pray at all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In praying tho' from ones heart; to beg rather temporall advantages, then the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Soul: to be ſolicitous to pray for health, for the goods of the world; and almoſt never to emplore the graces neceſſary for our Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To be wanting in our reſpect to God; in the time of prayer; or to talk and diſcourſe in holy places; and not behave ones ſelf there with due modeſty and gravity, either in looks, words, or other actions.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Theſe are greater faults, when they are committed during the holy Sacrifice of the Maſſe, and where the Angells attend trembling, and with low reſpect: and that which makes them ſo, is the contempt which is ſhew to God by theſe irreverences; and the great loſs we ſuffer of the ſeverall graces we might there receive, did we but pray with the attention, and devotion, which is fit. This deſerves to be well examined, for we often fall into theſe faults.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But 'tis a far greater ſin, when during the holy Sacrifice one employs his mind in evil thoughts, either of impurity, or revenge, or of other crimes.</p>
                  <p>The 9th. is to Communicate in the ſtate of mortal Sin.</p>
                  <p>The 10th. To make an ill Confeſſion, either not having all the conditions which it requires, or concealing ſome mortall Sin.</p>
                  <p>One might reduce wicked Oaths, and the breaking of Vows to the Sin againſt the virtue of Religion; but this will come more properly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:38446:134"/>the Second Commandment.</p>
                  <p>They who have Benefices may examen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this place in what concerns the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their State.</p>
                  <p>Whether they have omitted to ſay their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and how often, having no lawfull impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Whether they have performed it with the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or devotion which is neceſſary: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with extreme negligence; as it very often happens.</p>
                  <p>Whether they have neglected or refuſed to wear the Ecleſiaſticall habit; whether they have cloathed themſelves like Lay-men, in habit, colours, or dreſs.</p>
                  <p>Whether they have been immodeſt in their comportment, and negligent in giving good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>Whether they have miſapplyed the income of their Benefices; as in play, in good cheer, or other idle and unneceſſary expences.</p>
                  <p>Whether thay have omitted to give the alms, they are obliged to give, out of what remains of their Eccleſiaſticall revennes after they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed themſelves a juſt and moderate main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                  <p>Whether they retain their benefice without any deſign of becoming Church-men.</p>

                  <p>The Sin contrary to this obligation, is that which we call idleneſs, indevotion, and the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of our Salvation, or in one word Sloth, which the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and after them the <hi>Latins</hi> more properly name <hi>acedia,</hi> that is a wretched negligence, or want of care.

                  </q>
                  <p>The firſt Sin is the love of idleneſs, which makes one fly from labour, and chuſe rather to continue doing nothing, then employ himſelf in any lawfull and commendable exerciſe, which is a Sin that never comes alone, but carries after it a large train of many others. And in this point it is neceſſary to examen ones ſelf ſeriouſly and diſtinctly.</p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:38446:135"/>
                  <p>The 2d. is to be more carefull and Solicitous to labour in the concerns of our bodies or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall advantages, then for the Salvation of our Souls. It is a very Common Sin, of which however one ſeldome or never examens himſelf. Conſider then, whether you have not often totally neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and abandoned the care of your Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far from taking any care to labour in this great concern, as that you have not admitted even of a thought thereof. How long time have you paſt in this negligence?</p>
                  <p>The 3d. is to ſlight in his heart piety and good works, having a diſtaſt or an averſion for them; as it happens but too often to thoſe, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the negligence we have juſt now ſpoke of.</p>
                  <p>The 4th. is to defer from day to day and from time to time the amendment of ones life; or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to deſiſt after one has begun it.</p>
                  <p>The 5th. is to forſake thoſe means, which God hath vouchſaf't us for our amendment: Such as are the Sacraments, Penance, Prayer, good works. Or elſe to perform indeed theſe duties, but ſo ill, and with ſo little devotion, that they do one no good. Thus you muſt here examen your ſelf, whether, when you were conſcious to your ſelf that you were in danger to commit ſome mortall Sin, you have employed theſe means, to the end you might avoid it.</p>
                  <p>The 6th. is when either deſpairing ever to be able to amend, or preſuming that God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us at the laſt hour, we give our ſelves over totally to vice without ever concerning our ſelves at all to amend our lives. Which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly what St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>to heap up a

               <p>To form a right judgment of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; You muſt obſerve, that we do not here take this word <hi>Oath</hi> as it is vulgarly underſtood:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:38446:136"/>for ſo Blaſphemy as well as Curſing is called an Oath; but we take it preciſely and properly for the uſe which is made of the name of God, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or deny a thing: ſuch an uſe of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not bad: but on the contrary it is an act of Religion, when it is accompanied with the three circumſtances, which holy writ, <hi>Heirem.</hi> 4.2. requires an Oath ſhould have <hi>Truth, Juſtice, and Neceſſity.</hi> Hence the Commandment doth not at all forbid to Swear; but <hi>to Swear in vain,</hi> that is without theſe three conditions.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the firſt Sin againſt this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the taking a wicked Oath, that is,
<list>
                     <item>1. When one Swears an untruth, which one knows to be ſo.</item>
                     <item>2. When one Swears an unjuſt thing to the prejudice of our neighbour.</item>
                     <item>3. When one Swears without any neceſſity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the thing be both true and juſt.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now there is no neceſſity of an oath, except the thing for which one ſwears be of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p>One Sins moreover by an evil Oath, when one either Swears to do what he never deſigns to do; or when one ſwears to do an evill thing; in which caſe, the Oath doth not at all oblige; but it was a mortall Sin to Swear, and it would be another to fulfill his Oath.</p>
               <p>Theſe kind of Oaths are Sworn, when one ſays that he takes God to witneſs of a thing; or that he Swears upon his Salvation, upon the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Soul, by the oath he owes to God, that he may periſh in that inſtant, or ſuch like. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is neceſſary that they examen themſelves particularly well, who are accuſtomed to Swear,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:38446:137"/>and declare the number of theſe ſins, as near as they can.</p>
               <p>The 2. Sin is that of Blaſphemy, that is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and villify Almighty God; whether it be by denying him ſome perfection which is proper to him, as in ſaying that he is not Juſt, Good, Wiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in attributing to him, ſomething unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him; as to ſay that he is the author of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, or the like. Renouncing him either by word, or thought,: Curſing him; which never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but to ſuch Souls as are tranſported with rage and fury, as in loſſes, in Gaming, or upon occaſion of ſuch other Croſſes.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a kind of Blaſphemy, to ſwear by the name of God, by his Death, by his Blood; as often as all or any of theſe things ſhall be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in anger, or thro' contempt, and reproach, and always in abuſing Gods holy name, and the adorable Miſteries of our Redemption.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are ſubject to theſe Sins ought ſtrictly to examen themſelves in all theſe points.</p>
               <p>The 3. Sin is Curſing, that is when to affirm a thing, either mov'd by anger againſt any one, or thro' impatience of his croſſes and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, one flyes out into a paſſion ſo far as to wiſh harm to himſelf or others; as death or ſome misfortune: to wiſh at the Devil, or the like. Which choler but too often ſuggeſts to thoſe, who do not curb their paſſions.</p>
               <p>The 4. concerns the abuſe of Vows; which are promiſes one makes to God. This abuſe is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In making a vow to do that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible for him to fulfill.</item>
                  <item>2. In vowing to do that which is evill and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:38446:137"/>diſpleaſing to Almighty God.</item>
                  <item>3. In breaking vows which one has made.</item>
                  <item>4. In deferring too long to fulfill them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any lawfull cauſe of that delay.</item>

               <p n="1">1. The firſt Sin againſt this Commandment is to do on the Sunday any ſervile works, that is to ſay handy-works, which have ſome temporall gain for their end. Conſider whether you have done any, or whether you were the cauſe that others did, either by making them labour in your ſervice, or for your divertiſement, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo a ſin againſt this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be employed any conſiderable time upon holy-days in labouring about temporall affairs: as Merchants, Advocates, Solicitors, and other Officers of Juſtice do, who ſpend one part of the Sunday in buſineſs, and the other in recreation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is the Sin of omiſsion, as not to employ ones ſelfon theſe holy-days in pious exerciſes; and eſpecially not to hear Maſs as the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly Commands, under pain of Mortall ſin, or not to hear it well, but without attention or reverence. For altho' in this caſe one complys with the precepts of the Church, yet he doth not ſatisfy that of God, who commands us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form well and piouſly all holy duties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe cannot eaſily be exempt from Sin, who on theſe holy-days, neither think at all of God, nor their Salvation, who are neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:38446:138"/>at divine ſervice nor at Sermons; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe who make a cuſtome and an habit of it: for this is to neglect the Sanctification of the Sunday, and the end for which it was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which cannot be done without a great Sin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The greateſt and moſt greivous profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sunday and feſtivall-days is committed by thoſe, who ſpend theſe holy-days in idleneſs, in gaming, in dances, in feaſting, and other recreations, which inſtead of ſanctifying the feaſts, are a dishonour to them; and by this means God, who ought on thoſe days to be more particularly honoured, is much offended. Theſe profanations of Sundays and holy-days are very common and yet great Sins. And therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is to examin himſelf ſtrictly in this point.</p>

               <p>The Sins which Children commit againſt their Fathers and Mothers, are:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To deny them their due reſpect, as when they deſpiſe them interiourly in their heart, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly by words, ſcornfull geſtures, or actions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be deficient in the love they owe them; as when they hate them, or wiſh their death, or any other misfortune, or forſake them in their neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To fail in their obedience, if it be in a matter of Conſequence, it is a mortall Sin, or elſe to obey them, but not readily, as with repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, impatience, or deſpight. Or what is worſe, to obey them in things unlawfull.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To ſlight, to ſcoff at their reprehenſions, to take no notice of them, or not to benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To reſiſt their corrections, and wiſh them harm.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To put them into paſſion, and take no care to pacify them again by ſubmiſſive words, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying and complying with their deſires.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Not to aſſiſt them in their old age, in their ſickneſs, and in what other neceſſities.</p>
               <p>To theſe Sins may be added the not executing their laſt Will and Teſtament after their death, or not to procure Prayers for them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Diſciples and Schollars owe to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:38446:140"/>and to all thoſe who inſtruct them a great part of the ſame dutys; as reſpect, obedience, and the like, in which they ſhould examen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Servants ought to examen themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the obedience they owe to their Maſters; whether they have fail'd either in their truſt, or in the dilligence which is required at their hands; whether through their fault they have diſpleaſed them: whether they have neglected their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and juſt intereſt; whether they have obey'd them in things unlawfull, in lying, Swearing, Stealing, beating, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Subjects, whether they have fail'd to obey the King and the Magiſtrates, to obſerve their Laws and their Commands, and to bear a reſpect to their Perſons.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Towards their Eccleſiaſtical Superiours, as Biſhops, Curates, Confeſſors; whether one hath not fail'd to give ear to their Admonitions, to ſhew them reſpect, to love them, and obey them; whether on the contrary one hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned them, ſpoken ill of them, or murmured againſt them.</p>
               <p>Fathers and Mothers reciprocally ought to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether they have performed their duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Children; whether they love them as they ought; whether they have care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, and to ſupply them in their other Corporal neceſſities; whether they have been carefull of their Salvation, and to provide them all things neceſſary for that end, <hi>viz.</hi> to teach them to know God and fear him; to love him as their Heavenly Father; to inſtill into them the Sentiments of true Piety; to redreſs their
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:38446:140"/>faults by opportune and convenient reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; to correct them when they ſtand in need; not to flatter them in their vicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; as alſo not to be too ſevere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; to give them good, but never any bad Example: Never to force them in the choice of their State of Life; nor to love one more then another without a very good reaſon: not to take from one to give to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except it be according to the exact rules of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The Sins of other Superiours may be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mened upon all the Points here mentioned, proportionably to what may appertain to every one in his proper Poſt.</p>
               <p>Maſters ſhould conſider, how they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves towards their Servants: whether they have had a care of their Life and Converſation, and of their Salvation: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have been watchfull over their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reprehended their faults, made them ſay their Prayers, go to Maſs on Sundays, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-days, frequent the Sacraments. Whether they have not commanded them to do ſome evil thing, treated them too rudely either by words, injuries or ſtroaks; whether they have not paid their Wages, and ſo of others.</p>

               <p>There are three degrees in the ſin of Impurity.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:38446:142"/>
               <p>The Firſt contains the ſins of the exteriour Senſes, which ſerve as an entrance and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to this Vice.</p>
               <p>The Second comprehends the interiour ſins, which are committed againſt purity in the mind.</p>
               <p>The Third contains the different kinds of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure actions, by which one actually commits that ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is convenient then in the firſt place, that we examen the acts of the exteriour ſenſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Hearing, by which bad, as well as good enters into the mind. Whether one hath given Ear either to immodeſt words, diſcourſes, or Songs; wherein one may ſin four ways, 1. If one interiourly takes pleaſure therein. 2. If one ſhews that he willingly gives Ear unto them. 3. If one does not hinder them when he may. 4. If one do not avoid the company of thoſe, who ſpeak them, when it is not in his power to divert the diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the Sight, and that in divers manners. Whether one hath caſt his eyes with pleaſure, or deſign upon immodeſt objects, or ſuch as are capable to raiſe ill thoughts: as nakedneſs, diſhoneſt Pictures or Figures, Women, or Maids; either entertaining at the ſame time Laſcivious thoughts, or being in danger to admit them; which ordinarily is a Mortal Sin.</p>
               <p>Whether one hath read diſhoneſt books trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Love, immodeſt Stories, or other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt things; Whether one hath taken pleaſure in reading them: And altho' one took no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therein, yet the danger to which one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes himſelf to admit it, is the reaſon why one can ever ſcarce reade ſuch Books without a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:38446:142"/>fin: Whether one has kept ſuch books by him, for he is obliged to rid himſelf of them. Whether he hath imparted them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Whether one hath neglected to ſuppreſs them, when he might, either by himſelf, or by another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of the Tongue, one muſt examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath uttered immodeſt words, or uſed expreſsions bearing a double ſenſe, or apt to create in the Soul impure thoughts.</p>
               <p>Whether he hath held diſcourſe, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of this nature, recounted wanton Stories, reported his own or others wicked actions.</p>
               <p>Whether one hath ſollicited others to the ſin of impurity. Sung unchaſt Songs, or recited immodeſt Verſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of the Touch, whether one hath touched himſelf immodeſtly, that is, having no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but only pleaſure, or with danger of impurity; and yet more, whether one hath touched another with either of theſe two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, of pleaſure, or danger.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Second rank of immodeſt ſins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains thoſe which are committed in the mind: and under this head we muſt examine three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether one hath willingly taken plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in entertaining his mind in impure thoughts or imaginations; altho' one had not a deſire to put them in execution. For theſe thoughts, when one willingly continues in them, are Mortal ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When one has a deſire to Commit the ſins he thinks on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When one not only deſires it, but reſolves
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:38446:143"/>with himſelf to commit it, when he hath an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and for that end, ſeeks the means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his deſign.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third degree of this ſame ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the different kinds of immodeſt actions.</p>
               <p>Whereof the firſt is, when one provokes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Luſt, corrupting himſelf either by his touch or other means, which is a ſin concerning which Penitents, and eſpecially young people ought to examen themſelves well; becauſe they eaſily fall into it, and ſometimes either do not confeſs it, or elſe declare but one half, having a ſhame to diſcover, what they were not aſham'd to commit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When one ſollicites others to that ſin: When one makes them fall into it, or when one teaches it to tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that do not know it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When one commits the ſin of diſhoneſty, with perſons of divers Sexes and Unmarried; in which caſe he muſt firſt tell, whether ſhe were a Maid or Virgin, for that is a remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which aggravates the ſin. 2. Whether he ſollicited her, and how long. 3. Whether he ſeduced her by promiſes. Much more, whether he forced her; he ought alſo to declare here whether he hath been in evil houſes; whether he hath led, or been willing to lead others thither.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether one hath committed this ſin with a Married woman, which is Adultery: or with a relation, which is Inceſt, for theſe are different ſpecies, or kinds of Sin.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, whether one has been ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as to fall into the Sins againſt nature, which God hath ſometimes viſibly puniſhed with fire from Heaven, and with St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:38446:143"/>paſſions, all which nevertheleſs one muſt not be aſhamed to confeſs.</p>

               <p>Theſe Verſes contain four ſorts of Sin forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by this Commandment.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Whereof the firſt is falſe witneſs, and all that relates unto it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To accuſe one falſly whether in judgment, or elſewhere.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To bear falſe witneſs againſt him, and the heinouſneſs of this Sin is proportionable to the Crime, which is laid to his charge: and to the danger his neighbour incurs, whether in point of Eſtate, Honour, or Life. If the Teſtimony be confirmed with an oath the Sin becomes yet much more heinous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To take upon him the defence of a falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. Whether in law, which happens to Lawyers and Sollicitors, or elſewhere, in what manner ſoever it be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To condemn the innocent, or abſolve the guilty. A Sin incident to judges, and other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Second Species, or kind, is detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein one Sins by theſe degrees.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ill ſuſpitions of his neighbour upon ſmall grounds, ſometimes out of lightneſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by reaſon of an averſion one hath conceiv'd againſt him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By raſh judgments, where one believes or affirms ſome evil which one hath ſuſpected of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By detraction, ſpreading reports prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to his honour: which is done two ways: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by laying crimes to his charge, which he hath not committed, which is called Calumny, or by revealing the evil, which he hath done, when it was yet ſecret, and few or none knew
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:38446:145"/>of it, which is properly called defamation.</p>
               <p>This is ordinarily a mortall Sin; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it obliges to a reſtitution of the honour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thereby he hath taken from his neighbour; and when one confeſſes himſelf of it, he ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the quality of the crime, which he either impos'd upon him, or revealed: that alſo of the perſon whom he ſpoke ill of: whether it were in preſence of many perſons; and how often; the intention with which he ſpoke it, whether it were out of lightneſs and indiſcretion: or out of averſion, or envy; in which caſe the Sin is much greater.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The 3. Species is Lying; which is (not to tell a thing that is falſe, as the vulgar think but) to ſpeak a thing, which we judge to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then we ſay: It is always a Sin, either mortall, or veniall.</p>
               <p>It is a veniall Sin, when it brings no conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able damage neither to him that tells it, nor to others. Yet it is to be obſerved, that it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous thing to accuſtome ones ſelf unto it, and to get a habit of it, for the reaſons we alledg'd in the <hi>Inſtruction of Youth. part</hi> 4. <hi>capt.</hi> 11. But we muſt have a care not to confeſs by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome only, without a reſolution to amend, as it often happens.</p>
               <p>A Lye is a mortall Sin, when it is told in things of great moment, when it either prejudices our neighbour in an high degree or him that tells it. Whether in Soul or Body, whether in honour, or goods, is a point, which deſerves a ſtrict examen.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The 4th Species is Hypocriſy, which is a continuall lye, and diſſembling to the end to appear otherwiſe then one is. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the words he hath ſpoken with that intent. Whether one hath endeavoured to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed good and virtuous; whether one hath performed acts of piety with a deſign to appear ſo and be ſo eſteemed; whether one hath diſcourſed upon matters of devotion, mov'd with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and ſuch like things.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pride</hi> is <hi>an eſteem which one hath of himſelf, and a deſire to be eſteemed by others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The goods which one either hath, or believes he hath, are the ground-work and Foundation of this Eſteem; as the goods of Fortune, Riches, Honours, Dignities: or the goods of the Body; as Strength, Beauty, a good Grace, good Cloaths: or the goods of the Mind, as Knowledge, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Virtue.</p>
                  <p>This eſteem together with proper love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a vaſt number of ill effects, which are ſo many Sins of <hi>Pride.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Firſt is Vain Glory, which values it ſelf and deſires to be eſteemed by others, for the goods one either hath not, or thoſe he hath, but do not at all deſerve to be eſteemed; as Beauty, Cloaths, Riches: whence it derives its name <hi>vain</hi> or <hi>Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is Boaſting; when one ſeeks to publiſh, or as it were proclaim the goods he is endowed with, to the end he may be the more eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>The Third is the <hi>Pride</hi> which is called the ſwelling, or puffing up of the Mind, when one prizes himſelf exceſſively for the goods, which he believes himſelf Poſſeſſor of, and wherein he thinks he conſiderably ſurpaſſes others.</p>
                  <p>The 4th is Arrogance: when one attributes to himſelf the goods he hath not; or thoſe which he hath, but do not ſpring from us, but from
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:38446:148"/>God, or even from another, who hath beſtowed them on us; when one requires the Honour and Reſpect which is not due to him; when one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves himſelf to be the Author of a favour which one hath done him, or which one hath received from him, and doth not give the Glory of all to God.</p>
                  <p>The 5th is Preſumption: when one hath too good a conceit of himſelf, and believes himſelf capable of the things which are beyond his reach, or which one is not able to perform without the grace of God. And in a word when one confides in his own ſtrength in all the good things he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes, and not in the aſſiſtance of the Divine Grace.</p>
                  <p>The 6th is Ambition: when moved by the good conceit of himſelf, he ſeeks difficult Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; becauſe they are honourable, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, preſuming always upon himſelf that he is ſufficiently capable.</p>
                  <p>The 7th is a contempt which one hath of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: when by reaſon of the good opinion one hath of himſelf he ſets a greater value on his own, than on anothers Goods, Nobility, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Virtue: and when one ſhews this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by geſtures, words, or actions. When one would be preferred before others, and always have the chiefeſt Honour: when one abuſes his Inferiours, with affronts, and ſeverity, exacting from them more Service than they owe; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their faults with too much rigour.</p>
                  <p>The 8th is want of Submiſſion towards Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours: when one refuſes to obey them, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Orders: when one blames their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, when one murmurs, or cauſes others to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt them.</p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:38446:148"/>
                  <p>The 9th is not to acknowledge his faults, which may happen four manner of ways. 1. When one totally denies it, &amp; doth not at all believe he hath done amiſs. 2. When acknowledging it in his heart, he will not however Confeſs it, but denies to have done it. 3. When Confeſſing the Fact one maintains he hath done well, or that he hath not done amiſs. 4. When one alledges falſe excuſes and unjuſt reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The 10th is a contempt of Admonitions and Corrections; when one bears them imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ntly; when one is never the better by being corrected for his faults.</p>
                  <p>The 11th is Obſtinacy in his own opinions: when one reſolves to follow his own judgment in things of importance againſt the advice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to whom he ows reſpect.</p>
                  <p>The 12th is Diſcord: when one is of a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome humour towards others, not willing to yield in any thing; but to be above them in all things.</p>
                  <p>The 13th is Hypocriſy when one would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear better then he is: or be eſteemed Virtuous, and perform ſome good actions with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. We have already ſpoken of this in the Eighth Commandment.</p>

               <head>The Preface.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Neceſſity of this Inſtruction, and the Order to be obſerved therein.</head>
               <p>THis Inſtruction is no leſs neceſſary then that of of Penance; by reaſon that the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is the Complement, and perfection of what Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance had begun; that is to ſay, it is a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, and a certain confirmation of the Soul in the grace of God. It conſerves, it augments, it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the Soul dayly more and more in his holy grace, and contributes very much towards finall Perſeverance, ſuppoſing it be frequently made uſe of; and that the receiver approach unto it with thoſe diſpoſitions, which ſo holy and ſo adorable a Sacrament requires. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary it heaps upon the head of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiver, dreadfull and almoſt irreparable ruins, changing the fountain of life into the cauſe of death; and that, which of it ſelf, and by its firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, was a pledge of Salvation, a Sacrament of Love and Mercy, into a Sentence of Condemnation or Everlaſting death.</p>
               <p>If one Communicate, tho' not abſolutely unworthy, that is, in the State of Mortal ſin; but however with ſome irreverence, or conſiderable defect in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, he is deprived of the better part of that fruit, which otherwiſe he might gather from this Tree of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:38446:155"/>Life. And not only that; he doth not only loſe the many favours he might by means of the Sacrament be partaker of: but alſo he thereby contracts a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of infirmities, as tepidity, or coldneſs in Charity, indevotion, inſenſibility in the concerns of our Soul, the diminution of our Spiritual ſtrength and Divine Graces, frequent relapſes into Venial, and ſometimes into Mortal ſin.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, <hi>Theotime,</hi> of what importance it is to perform this great action well. No leſs then your Salvation depends upon the right performance of it, Now to do this worthily, as the thing deſerves, it is neceſſary we be well informed; whence it is eaſy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>1.</hi> How uſefull Inſtruction is upon this Subject, <hi>2.</hi> The Obligation you have to apply your ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the reading of it, ſo to advantage your ſelf the more thereby.</p>

                  <head>The Diviſion.</head>
                  <p>I Shall divide this Treatiſe into two Parts; whereof the Firſt ſhall treat of the Doctrin; The Second of the Practice of Holy Communion. In the Firſt, I ſhall declare what it imports us to know concerning this ſublime Myſtery; and in the Second what we are to do, to receive it worthily and with fruit.</p>
                  <p>In the Firſt Part I ſhall give ſome Generall Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Faith it ſelf and of the Principal Myſteries of our Faith, for the greater Convenience of thoſe, who are not already ſo fully inſtructed in theſe ſo neceſſary concerns; and Especially of young People, who very ſeldom have ſufficient knowledge of them.</p>
                  <p>I hope that thoſe, who ſhall peruſe them with Care, and a Deſire to Learn, will find therein ſuch and ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Inſtructions in all the Fundamentall Points of our
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:38446:155"/>Holy Religion, as by that means their Hearts will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ample and Capacious of the ſingular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Holy Communion; and Effectually be made Partakers of thoſe Graces which God is ready to beſtow by means of this Bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>As for the Second Part it is to be peruſed and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized, &amp; for this effect it will be very proper to peruſe it often and with Attention; but particularly upon the Eve and day of Communion.</p>

                  <hi>PART I.</hi> Of the Doctrin, that is to ſay, of the Truths which it Imports us to know concerning the Sacrament of the Euchariſt.</head>
               <p>A Chriſtian Communicant, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive worthily (if as yet he know them not diſtinctly) ought to be well inſtructed in three things; of which two are generall, the third is particular to this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he muſt be inſtructed in Faith in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, without which it is impoſſible to attain to the knowledge of this great Myſtery of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. He muſt underſtand perfectly well, what God hath reveal'd concerning this Virtue, which is the Baſis and ground-work of Salvation. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Heb. 11.1. <hi>The Subſtance of the things to be hoped for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He muſt have a true Notion of the Principal Myſteries of Faith in Particular; as of the Bleſſed Trinity, the Incarnation, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:38446:156"/>the Catholick Chuch: for except he believe theſe Truths, it is impoſſible ever to come either to the knowledg or belief of that of the Holy Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He muſt be throughly informed in what concerns this Sacrament in particular; <hi>viz.</hi> in the principal truths which appertain unto it: as the real preſence of the Son of God in the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Hoſt: The change of the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine, into that of his Body and Blood: The great wonders, which meet in this Myſtery: The effects, which it produces in the Soul of the worthy receiver. The diſpoſitions, with which it ought to be received.</p>
               <p>Following this order, I ſhall divide this Firſt Part into three Chapters, whereof the Firſt ſhall treat of Faith; the Second of the Principal My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our Faith; the Third of what concerns this Sacrament in particular: And we ſhall divide the Chapters into Articles, or Queſtions, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſhall require.</p>

                     <p>IT is a gift of God, or a light from above by which man being illuminated doth firmly believe all thoſe things, which God hath revealed, and propoſed to his Church to be believed; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written, or unwritten.</p>

                     <p>And firſt it teacheth us, that Faith is a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural light proceeding not from us, but from God; and which makes us aſſent to thoſe truths, the belief whereof is neceſſary for Salvation.</p>

                     <p>I Anſwer, God alone. <hi>Faith is a gift of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. and there is none but he can give it. He beſtows it upon us

The will indeed concurrs, and doth well in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting and agreeing with the truth, which is propoſed unto her: but it is God alone, who is the firſt and principal cauſe; wherefore it is very neceſſary that we beg and require it at his hands.</p>

                     <p>TO believe, that is to hold a truth for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and aſſured, without the leaſt doubt thereof, is the proper act of Faith.</p>
                     <p>The object, that is, the things which we are oblig'd to believe, are all the truths which God hath revealed, and which are therefore propoſed that we may aſſent unto them.</p>
                     <p>The motive or reaſon why we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is the divine revelation: For one believes a truth, becauſe God, who neither can deceive us, nor be deceived in what he reveals unto us, hath revealed it.

                        <hi>Queſt. VI.</hi> Which is the Rule of Faith?</head>
                     <p>WE call that the Rule of Faith, whereby we diſcern the revelations which come, from thoſe which do not come, from God; for it is certain that there are ſome falſe revelations, and which the Devil, the Author of Lies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes by his Miniſters; and therefore, that we may not be be deceived, we have a certain rule.</p>
                     <p>This rule is the judgment, or the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Church, to which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that Power, and promiſed the aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, that it alſo may never be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>The Proofs are manifeſt in the Scripture; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Mat.</hi> 28.20. (ſaith he) <hi>I am with you even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of the World.</hi> He alſo ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Rock will I build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith afterwards, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. that the Church is <hi>the Houſe of God,</hi> and that it is <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi> The Son of God commands us to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to it even as to himſelf. <hi>Luc.</hi> 10.16. <hi>He, that heareth you heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. <hi>he who will not hear the Church, let him be accounted as a heathen or Publican.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Without this Rule we can have no Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without it we can neither be aſſured of the Divine Revelation, nor of the true Scriptures, nor of their true Senſe; wherefore Hereticks, who refuſe to follow the Judgment of the Church, have neither Faith, not even any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:38446:158"/>of any thing they believe.</p>
                     <p>They ſay indeed that they follow the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but they deceive themſelves.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, How do they know, that there is ſuch a thing as Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the Catholick Church, which aſſures us of it, and hath conſerved it from time to time, even untill their times. Did not St. <hi>Auguſtin, contra Epiſt. fundam. c.</hi> 5. ſay, and with good reaſon, that <hi>he would not believe the Goſpel, except he were moved unto it by the authority of the Catholick Church:</hi> and that <hi>if we believe the Church, when it tells us that we muſt believe the Goſpel, why ſhould we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, when it forbids us to believe</hi> Manicheus <hi>or Hereticks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is not enough to follow the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, except alſo they follow and be aſſured of the true Senſe of Scripture; for as St. <hi>Auguſtin, in tract.</hi> 18. <hi>in Jo.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hereſy ſprings from no other ſource, but from good Scripture ill underſtood, and boldly maintained:</hi> And St. <hi>Hilary, l.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. Auguſt.</hi> ſaith excellently well, <hi>That there is no Heretick but maintains his Blaſphemies by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If they fay that the Holy Ghoſt inſpires them with the true Senſe of the Scriptures, and the right underſtanding of the Myſteries therein contained.</p>
                     <p>The Anſwer is impertinent; for there was never any Heretick, who had not this ſame Plea.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If it be ſo, why are there ſo many different Sentiments amongſt them, and that in Points of Faith? Can the Holy Ghoſt be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to, or contradict himſelf? Is it poſsible that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:38446:158"/>he ſhould inſpire both truth and falſhood?</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly. who is it that doth not perceive that this anſwer, were it good, would authorize as many religions, as there are men? for every one will eaſily ſay that he hath the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, why do they deſire, that others ſhould believe them, whilſt they affirm that they have the H. Ghoſt, having nothing beſides there own aſſertion to juſtify what they ſay; ſince they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves refuſe to believe the Church, which requires their aſſent by ſo juſt a title, as is the promiſe made her by the Son of God of the continuall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his H. Spirit, even to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>We muſt then conclude, and hold for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth, that it is neither our private judgment, nor our interiour perſwaſion, however we may, believe it comes from the Holy Ghoſt, which is capable to ſerve us as a rule in points of Faith, or can make us ſee which is a true, and which a falſe revelation: but it is the ſole Teſtimony of the Catholick Church, and the judgment which ſhe forms of the divine truths, which is and ought to be the rule of our belief. For whilſt we ſubmit our ſelves to her judgment we cannot fall. As we cannot but miſtake and err, when tho' never ſo little we depart from the doctrine of the Church.</p>
                     <p>We find in the Church four conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the rule of ſaith: To be a rule, it muſt at one and the ſame time be <hi>One, Certain, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,</hi> and <hi>Viſible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Church is <hi>One,</hi> for as there can be but one Faith, ſo there can be no more then one true Church, as it is ſaid in the Nicene Creed, <hi>Et unam Sanctam Catholicam, &amp; Apoſtolicam Eccleſiam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:38446:159"/>
                     <p>The judgment of the Church is <hi>Certain</hi> in points of faith, ſince ſhe can never fail being, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the Pillar and ground of truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> becauſe clearly propoſed, and by word of mouth explained upon occaſion of any Emergent difficulty in matters of faith.</p>
                     <p>The Church for this reaſon was Eſtabliſhed by the Son of God: his will is, that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto her in theſe occaſions, according as it was alſo practiced in the Old Teſtament, where it is ſaid <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. that <hi>the lips of the Prieſt do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve knowledge, and one muſt ſeek the Law from his mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Apoſtle aſſures us, that the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is to be obſerved in the New Teſtament, when he ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. that the Son of God <hi>hath eſtabliſhed ſome Apoſtles, ſome Paſtours, and other ſome Doctors for the adminiſtration of his word, &amp; for the building up of the body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is his Church. <hi>That we may not be like Children wavering in uncertainty, and carried away with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> And for this reaſon alſo St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> affirms, that in all difficulties which occurr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any queſtions or matters of Faith, we muſt make our addreſſes to the Church. <hi>If any one,</hi> ſaith he, cont.

Si quis falli metuit hujus obſcuritate queſtionis, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam. de illâ conſulat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the Church is <hi>Viſible,</hi> as conſiſting of Paſtours, who have ſucceeded one another ever ſince the Apoſtles, even unto this preſent time; and as in all ages one might, ſo at this very time one may eaſily addreſs himſelf unto them to be inſtructed in all what concerns our faith. This
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:38446:159"/>is the City, whereof the Son of God ſpeaks <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14. <hi>which is built upon a Mountain</hi> to which all the World may have acceſs, as it was foretold by <hi>Iſaias.</hi> Chap. 2.3. <hi>Come and aſcend to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Lord, to the Houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob. <hi>It will teach us his ways, and we ſhall walk in his paths, for the Law will come forth of</hi> Sion, <hi>and the word of our Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem.

                     <p>I have ſtaid and dilated my ſelf on ſet purpoſe upon this Subject of the Rule of Faith, becauſe it is of great concern in this affair, and upon which all the reſt, as far as concerns us, depends; it is a Principle and Fundamental Maxim in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, That we muſt hearken to, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Church; we muſt receive the Divine Revelations from her alone, and the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe gives of the Holy Scripture and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which are the two ways by which as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid, God hath been pleaſed to convey his Divine Truths, the Myſteries of our Holy Faith, unto us.</p>

You rather give credit to your ſelves, then to the Gospell; becauſe when led by your private Spirit you approve, what pleaſeth, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what diſpleaſes you in Scripture; you do not at all ſubmit your ſelves to the authority of holy writ there to find out your faith; but rather you ſubject the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to your ſelves, to judge of it according to your will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, Faith ought to be <hi>firm,</hi> that is fixed, ſteddy and free from any at leaſt <hi>voluntary</hi> doubt. And this alſo for the ſame reaſon; the infallible authority of the Church, which propoſes unto us the divine truths the objects of our Faith, and cannot be deceived in what ſhe propoſes to us. So that there is no more reaſon to doubt of any one truth, then of all the reſt. And there is not a better way to diſpell with eaſe the doubts which ariſe againſt any one article of our faith, then to reflect upon the others which one believes with all the certainty imaginable; which yet are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe grounded then upon the ſame authority of the Church: for if we do not doubt of thoſe, neither ought we to queſtion theſe. In all the doubts, which may occur, concerning any point or points of faith, whether they ariſe from our own imaginations, or ſpring from occaſion of Hereſy, new doctrins, or ſcandall given in the Church, we ought to have recourſe to this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as to a ſecure refuge.

                     <p>FOur things.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt, <hi>I believe in God,</hi> that <hi>God is:</hi> that is, that there is one only true God, who is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Being, Eternall, Independent, Infinite in perfections, in Knowledge, in Power, in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in Goodneſs, in Juſtice, and in all other things.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Father Almighty, and in his only Son, I believe in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that in God there are three Perſons, The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt. That all theſe three are but one true God, having the ſelf ſame divine Eſſence, the ſelf ſame Wiſdom, the ſelf ſame Goodneſs, the ſelf ſame Power, and ſo of the other divine perfections. That the Son the Eternal Word proceeds from the underſtanding of the Father by a perfect Knowledge, which the Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives of himſelf; by which he expreſſes his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the Son. And the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father and the Son by a Mutuall love, which they bear one another. That theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions do not cauſe any inequality, or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or priority amongſt the Divine Perſons, who are all Equall and Eternall; as being all but one only true God; One in Nature, and three in Perſons.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Creator of Heaven and Earth.</hi> That God is the authour and creator of all things, that he hath made both Heaven and Earth and all the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:38446:162"/>creatures therein, whether viſible or inviſible, of nothing by his only word. That he conſerves them by his power, and governs them by his wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Life Everlaſting.</hi> That as he is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and firſt cauſe, ſo alſo he is the end of all things, and particularly of Men and Angels: whom he created to adore and ſerve him; and for whom he hath prepared eternall happineſs, which will conſiſt in this, that the bleſſed ſhall ſee him perfectly, and enjoy him as he is in himſelf, and this enjoyment ſhall endure for all eternity: it ſhall never, no never end.</p>

                        <p>Whence it plainly follows that in Jeſus Chriſt there are two Natures, and one only Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> the one divine, the other humane nature, both united in one &amp; the ſame Perſon of the Son of God, or the eternal word: whereas on the contrary in the divinity there is but one Nature, &amp; three Perſons.</p>

                        <p>WHen the fulneſs of time was come that God had decreed to ſend his Son for the redemption of Mankind, he diſmis'd from Heaven an Angell Meſſenger to the Bleſſed Virgin (whom above all others he had choſen, and in whom he had ordain'd, this adorable myſtery ſhould be perform'd) to declare unto her it was his will, that ſhe ſhould be the temporall Mother of the Son of God.</p>
                        <p>She had no ſooner yielded, and concurr'd with her conſent to the accompliſhing of the will of God thus manifeſted unto her, but the Almighty power frames in her Virginal womb an humane body out of her pureſt blood, creating in the ſame inſtant a rationall Soul to animate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; and in that ſame moment the Word, who from all eternity terminates the Divinity, began in time to terminate the Humanity of our Lord, Uniting in his Perſon the two, divine &amp; humane, Natures. And thus was fulfill'd that divine truth recorded by St. John, <hi>Verbum caro factum eſt. The word was made Fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Bleſſed Virgin having thus conceived the Son of God, by the ſpeciall work of the Holy Ghoſt, at the end of nine months ſhe brings him forth into the world, nouriſhes, maintains and breeds him up as other mothers uſe to do their Children: and the Son of God lived with her thus unknown to the world untill the age of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:38446:163"/>thirty years; thenceforward only he began to manifeſt himſelf, and to commence the work of our redemption for which he came.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, he <hi>Suffer'd under Pontius Pilate</hi> a moſt bitter Paſſion and death upon the Croſs; upon which he offer'd himſelf a Sacrifice in ſatisfaction to the divine Juſtice for the Sins of all mankind, and recompenſation for the infinite injury, which thereby was done to the divine Majeſty &amp; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and by this means to open the gates of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life for man to enter, which till that time were ſhut againſt both <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity: Having performed this duty, <hi>the third day he roſe again from the dead;</hi> and after that by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent apparitions he had proved the truth of his Reſurrection for the ſpace of forty days, <hi>he Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> glorious and triumphant <hi>into Heaven, from whence</hi> at the end of the World <hi>he ſhall come to judge both the quick and the dead,</hi> all men according to their merits; who for that end ſhall be raiſed from death to life and appear before him, never more to die, but receive either an Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their good, or everlaſting Puniſhment for their evil works.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, he eſtabliſh'd and confirm'd his

                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, he inſtituted the Sacraments as the means to convey unto us the merits of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as ſo many pretious Veſſels, wherein is preſerved the price of that adorable blood, which he hath ſo abundantly ſhed for us; to the end it might be applied unto us, according as the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of our Salvation ſhould require.</p>
                        <p>And for as much as theſe two laſt heads require a larger Explication; we ſhall treat of them here in two diſtinct Articles.</p>

                     <p>I <hi>Believe the Holy Catholique Church, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We muſt firſt believe that it is the Myſticall Body of which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Head; or a Congregation of the Faithfull holding the ſame Doctrin or Faith, which he taught, uſing the ſame Sacraments, which he inſtituted, living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of the Apoſtles and ſucceeding Paſtours, and acknowledging the ſame viſible Head, the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Chief Biſhop and true Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that there is but <hi>one Church,</hi> as there is but <hi>one God, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:38446:164"/>St. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 4.4. ſaith, <hi>unum corpus, &amp; unus Spiritus, unus Dominus, una Fides, unum Baptiſma, unus Deus &amp; Pater omnium. He that doth not conſerve this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> de unitat. Eccleſ. <hi>how can he believe that he hath Faith? he who oppoſes and reſiſts the Church; who abandons the Chair of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>upon which the Church is built, how can he hope that he is in the Church? ſince the bleſſed Apoſtle teacheth this ſame thing, and ſhewing the ſacred tye of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, affirming, that there is but one body, (that is the Church) as there is but one Spirit, who governs it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that this is that only Church, which acknowledgeth the Pope for her viſible head, whom <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath appointed to govern her, and to be the ſource and Center of her Unity here on Earth: which made St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſay, <hi>ibid.</hi> that Hereſies and Schiſms ſpring from hence, that ſome will not acknowledge in the Church one whom <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> conſtituted head over the reſt in thoſe words, which he ſpoke to St. <hi>Peter, Thou art</hi> Peter <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church: and I will give to thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>feed my Sheep: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon one man,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Ibid. <hi>he builds his Church, and gives him charge to feed his Flock. And although he beſtow'd an equal authority upon the Apoſtles</hi> as far as concerns the remiſſion of Sins: <hi>Yet that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church might more clearly appear, he hath ordain'd one Chair; and</hi> it was his will <hi>that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity take its Original and beginning from one man:</hi> and a little after he ſaith, that the <hi>Primacy was given to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>to ſhew that the Church of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and the Chair was one.</hi> St. <hi>Hierome L.</hi> 1. <hi>in Jovinian,</hi> ſays the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That St. <hi>Peter</hi>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:38446:165"/>was preferred before the other Apoſtles, to be the head of the Church; <hi>to the end that the head being one, all occaſion of diviſion in the Church might be removed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we are obliged to believe that there is no Salvation for any one out of this one true Church. It is an Article of Faith, which hath been held conſtantly in the Church; this having always been an unqueſtion'd and current Maxim; that he who will not have the <hi>Church for his Mother</hi> ſhall not have <hi>God for his Father.</hi> Which was the reaſon why St. <hi>Hierome</hi> finding himſelf in the Eaſt, where there was ſome diviſion upon this Subject, the names of the three Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity, writ to Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> Epi. 57. that he was reſolved never to depart from him, but inſeparably to unite himſelf unto him, as to one, who held the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> upon which ſays he, <hi>I know that the Church is built.</hi> Adding that the Church thus built is the only houſe, where it is lawfull to Eat the Paſchal Lamb, the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> out of which during the Flood none were ſaved, <hi>he, that doth not gather with the</hi> Pope, <hi>ſcattereth that is,</hi> he who is not united to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> doth aſſociate himſelf with Anti-Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, we are alſo obliged to believe that this true Church is Infallible in her judgments in matters of Faith and Doctrine concerning man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: whether ſhe be or be not aſſembled in the perſons of her Paſtours and Head: <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope, and Biſhops, ſhe holds univerſally one and the ſame Doctrine. This is alſo an Article of Faith grounded upon the word of the Son of God, who hath promiſed that <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt her,</hi> his Church: from whence it
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:38446:165"/>follows that ſhe never either fell, or ever ſhall fall into the leaſt error in points of faith: ſhe being as the Apoſtle affirms the <hi>Pillar and ground of truth.</hi> But we have already prov'd this truth above in the firſt Article.</p>
                     <p>Now from all what we have ſaid, both in the firſt Article, and in the preſent queſtion, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that we muſt conclude and hold this for a certain and infallible truth, that all ſaithfull Chriſtians, whoſoever deſire to be aſſured in points of faith, and ſound Doctrine concerning Manners, and to avoid error in a matter of ſo great concern, muſt of neceſſity adhere and ſtick cloſe ſolely &amp; inſeperably to the Holy Catholick, Apoſtolick, and Roman Church, and hear and follow her Judgment and Doctrine in all things.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICLE IV.</hi> What are we obliged to believe concerning the Sacraments?</head>
                     <p>I Believe <hi>the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> We are obliged to believe what the Church hath always taught concerning the Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that they are the means inſtituted by God, thereby either to confer his Grace upon us, or to augment, what we have already received, or to reſtore what we had loſt, as it is expreſſed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Proaem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that a <hi>Sacrament</hi> may be rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in this manner; <hi>a Viſible ſigne of inviſible grace inſtituted by God for our ſanctification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That this Viſible ſign conſiſts, and is, as it
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:38446:166"/>were compoſed of two parts, <hi>viz. the ſenſible thing,</hi> which is applyed in the Sacrament, as water in Baptiſm: and the <hi>words</hi> which are pronounced, as in the ſame Beptiſm theſe words. <hi>I baptize thee &amp;c.</hi> according to that received doctrine delivered by St. <hi>Auguſtin, Accedit verbum ad Elementum &amp; fit Sacramentum. By the joyning of the words with the Element,</hi> or Material thing, <hi>the Sacrament</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes compleat. One of theſe two parts is called the matter, the other the form of the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the Sacrament being applyed by a lawfull Miniſter, either gives or augments Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace in the Soul of the worthy receiver.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That there are Seven Sacraments: <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, Confirmation, Euchariſt, Penance, Extreme Unction, Order, Matrimony.</p>
                     <p>Baptiſm makes us the Children of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Waſhing us from the Stains of Original ſin, and enlivening our Soul with the Life of Grace, whence St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Baptiſm, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>the laver of regeneration, and the renovation of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Confirmation ſtrengthens us, and conſerves, and confirms us in the faith we received in Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>The Holy Euchariſt is the nouriſhment of the Soul, for as by Meat and Drink our decayed Spirits are revived; ſo by the uſe of the Bleſſed Sacrament thoſe damages, which Charity dayly ſuffers from humane frailty are repaired.</p>
                     <p>Penance reſtores us to the Grace of God, which we had loſt by ſin.</p>
                     <p>Extreme Unction gives us ſtrength at the hour of death, that we may be the better able to fight againſt our Ghoſtly Enemy in that laſt Moment, upon which Eternily depends; it is a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:38446:166"/>Spirituall weakneſs contracted by our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sins.</p>
                     <p>Order conſecrates the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and gives them power to conferr the Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>Matrimony ſanctifies the contract betwixt man and woman, and gives them grace to comply with the obligations which they draw upon themſelves by that indiſſoluble Bond inſtituted by God for the propagation of Mankind; and raiſed to the dignity of a Sacrament by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Altho' all or every one of the Sacraments do cauſe ſanctifying grace, yet they do not every one produce it in the ſame manner; for there are two, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm and Penance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the remiſſion of Sins, which conferr it upon thoſe, whom they find void of grace; from whence it is that they are called the Sacraments of the dead; that is to ſay of thoſe, who are dead in the ſight of God in the ſtate of Mortal Sin, whom they raiſe up from that death to the life of grace; whereas all the reſt are called the Sacraments of the living, in as much, as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the grace they find precedently in the Soul; and to receive any one of theſe worthily it is neceſſary that we be in the ſtate of grace.</p>
                     <p>The Soul by each Sacrament is not only ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by habitual, but alſo endowed with actual grace, that is, with a vigour and ſtrength to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the compaſſing of thoſe particular effects, for which it was firſt inſtituted and ordained.</p>
                     <p>Moreover there are three, which imprint a character in the Soul; Baptiſm, Confirmation, and Order: this Character is a Spiritual Mark or Seal which God makes in his Soul, who receives
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:38446:167"/>any of theſe three Sacraments; which impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it can never be raſed out, none of theſe three Sacraments can be reiterated, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſecond time by the ſame Perſon without a Sacrilege.</p>

                  <p>ALL what we have ſaid hitherto, whether of Faith in general, or in particular of the Divinity it ſelf, of the Incarnation of the Son of God, of the Holy Church, and of the Sacraments, ſerve only as ſo many ſteps or diſpoſitions to the belief of the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and to render the underſtanding of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable Myſtery more eaſy to us; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall here endeavour to explain as brief and ſhort, as poſsibly we may.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall reduce all whatſoever we are obliged to know concerning it into four heads. 1. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prefence of the Son of God in the Sacrament. 2. The Wonders inſeparably annext unto it. 3. The effects, which it is capable to produce. 4. The diſpoſitions neceſſary to receive it.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>ARTICLE I.</hi> Of the real preſence of the Son of God in the Holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and of what we are to believe concerning this Sacrament.</head>
                     <p>WE are obliged to believe, that it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament inſtituted by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> wherein he gives us really and truly his Body and Blood under the ſpecies or exteriour appearance of Bread and Wine for our Spiritual nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and refection.</p>
                     <p>There is not any one particle of this general Aſſertion or Tenet of our Faith, which doth not require to be well and diſtinctly underſtood; and for this reaſon I ſhall explain every one of them in order, as they lie.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, we believe that it is a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> that is, a viſible ſign of inviſible grace inſtituted by God for our ſanctification.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we believe that this Sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>really Jeſus Chriſt</hi> all whole and entire, that is, his Body and Blood, his Soul, and Divinity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that <hi>under the Species,</hi> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there remains nothing of the ſubſtance, but only the appearance of Bread and Wine; both ſubſtances being truly changed into the Body and Blood of the Son of God: ſo that what we ſee of Bread and Wine, as bigneſs, figure, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſmell, taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are only the accidents and the outward and ſenſible appearance of Bread and Wine.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that it is <hi>He, God</hi> by his Almighty
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:38446:168"/>Power, who works this wonderfull change by vertue of the words of Conſecration, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood,</hi> in that very moment, in which the Prieſt in the Perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> makes an end of the pronunciation of them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That in vertue of theſe Divine words the Body of the Son of God becomes really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent under the ſpecies of Bread, not by it ſelf, or all alone, but together with his Blood, his Soul, and Divinity: and his Blood alſo under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Wine, not ſingly by it ſelf, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his Body, his Soul, and his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; with this difference that the Body becomes preſent there under the ſpecies of Bread preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly by the vertue and ſignification of the words, and the reſt, that is to ſay, the Blood, Soul, and Divinity, are there by concomitance only, and by a neceſſary conſequence: becauſe the Son of God being alive, and the Divinity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inſeparably united to his Humanity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his Body is, there alſo is his Blood, his Soul, and his Divinity.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of his Blood, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes preſent under the ſpecies of Wine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly by the ſignification of the words; and his Body, his Soul, and his Divinity are alſo there by a neceſſary ſequel and concomitance.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> continues whole and entire under the ſpecies of Bread and Wine, in a Spiritual manner, that is, without his Quantity and natural extenſion, after the manner of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is, whole in the whole Hoſt, and whole in every part of the Hoſt; ſo that he is there inviſible, indiviſible, and impaſsible.</p>
                     <p>And therefore when the Hoſt is divided, the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:38446:168"/>Son of God is not divided, nor broken; but he continues entire in each ſmall particle of the Hoſt, as he was before the diviſion in the whole; and he who receives any tho' the leaſt part of the Hoſt, receives <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> whole and entire, as much as if he had received the whole.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>ARTICLE II.</hi> Of the Wonders which occurr in this Sacrament.</head>
                     <p>MAny and almoſt innumerable are the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Miracles, which God works by his Almighty Power in this great Myſtery, whereof ſeven are more remarkable.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, that the Son of God in that very moment the words are pronounced becomes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent in the Euchariſt: and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Heaven where he ſtill remains, his Body becomes truly preſent in the Sacred Hoſt, where before the Conſecration it never was.</p>
                     <p>The Second which follows from the Firſt, is, that the Body of the Son of God is at one and the ſame time truly in many places; and in as many, as there are Conſecrated Hoſts.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, this admirable change of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine into the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood of the Son of God; ſo that at the moment of Conſecration the Bread is no more Bread, and the Wine is no more Wine. <hi>Before Conſecration,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Ambroſe, l.</hi> 4. <hi>de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. c.</hi> 4. <hi>the Bread is Bread, after Conſecration, of Bread it becomes the Body of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Miracle is, that the accidents of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:38446:169"/>Bread and Wine after the Conſecration ſubſiſt ſeparate from their proper ſubſtance, which 'till then ſuſtained them, God by his Omnipotence preſerving them thus in being.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth is, that the Body of the Son of God is all whole, entire and perfect in the Hoſt, yet without taking up any place as other Bodies do, but after a Spiritual manner; ſo that it is whole and totally entire in the whole Hoſt, and alſo whole and totally entire in each part of every Hoſt, after the manner of Spiritual things; as for example, the Soul, which is all whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in the whole, and all whole and entire in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of the Body: from whence it follows of neceſsity that the body of the Son of God, is as entire under the leaſt, as under the greateſt part of the Hoſt, and he, who receives but one part of the Hoſt, receives as much, as he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the whole.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth which follows from the former, that tho' the Hoſt be divided or broken into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Parts, the Body of the Son of God is neither divided nor broken, becauſe being Indiviſible he continues in each part, as he was before.</p>
                     <p>The Seventh is, when the Hoſt is conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Body of the Son of God is not conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated nor corrupted; that altogether divine Body being incapable of any alteration: what happens to it in that moment is only this; it leaves or ceaſeth to be in the Sacrament, when the accidents of Bread or Wine are Corrupted and ceaſe to be any longer the Accidents of Bread and Wine.</p>
                     <p>All theſe and innumerable other wonders with which this Sacrament abounds, and which it is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:38446:169"/>impoſſible to relate, much more to comprehend, oblige us to look upon it, as an Abridgment of all the wonderfull effects of the Almighty Power, according to that of <hi>David. Pſalm.</hi> 110.4. (where ſo long before by a Prophetick Spirit he foretold, that God, as a ſpeciall token of his Mercy, had made an abridgment of his Marvells in giving Meat to them that fear him) and to behold it as the moſt endearing pledge, which <hi>our Redeemer,</hi> as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath it, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>being ready to depart from this World to his Father, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up,</hi> as we may ſay, <hi>all the riches of his divine love to men, moſt liberally beſtowed upon us.</hi>

                        <hi>ARTICLE III.</hi> Of the Effects of the Holy Euchariſt.</head>
                     <p>FRom what hath been ſaid, it is eaſy to judge of the great effects this Sacrament is capable and ordain'd to produce in the Soul of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. For as God hath wrought all theſe ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, and ſo incomprehenſible wonders for our ſakes; it muſt needs be that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to work in us moſt powerfull effects of his Grace.</p>
                     <p>The Son of God by his infinite wiſdom hath compriſed them all in one word, ſaying <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.56. that <hi>his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed, and that he who eateth his body and drinks his blood remains in him, and he,</hi> Jeſus, interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably remains <hi>in him</hi> who eats him.</p>
                     <p>From theſe divine words it follows that the fleſh of the Son of God, as a Divine nouriſhment works in the Soul of the worthy receiver, the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:38446:170"/>ſame effects Spiritually, which the beſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral nouriſhment produceth corporally in the body of thoſe, who take it. Now the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of corporal nouriſhment are four or five. 1. It conſerves life. 2. It makes one grow or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. 3. It fortifies us. 4. It preſerves us againſt diſtempers. Infine, it gives us ſtrength to be able to labour, and to comply with all our reſpective duties.</p>
                     <p>By theſe we may judge of the effects of the Holy Euchariſt.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is to conſerve Grace, which is the life of the Soul, and therefore it is called the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Bread which gives Life</hi> unto the World.</p>
                     <p>The Second, is to augment the ſame grace, and encreaſe the Chriſtian Virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity. This effect however it be common to all the Sacraments; yet it is more peculiar to this, as being more particularly inſtituted for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Soul, and to make us increaſe and proceed from Virtue to Virtue till we come to the houſe of God.</p>
                     <p>The third, is to ſtrengthen us againſt ſin, and the temptations, which incline that way, hence the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> affirm'd, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 2. that <hi>this Sacrament is a preſervative againſt Mortal, and a remedy againſt Venial Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth effect is, that it heals the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that is, the paſſions, and diſorderly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul. It weakens concupiſcence, or gives new ſtrength to overcome it. It diminiſhes Choler, Envy, Pride, and other Vices, as St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Serm. de Coena Domini,</hi> excellently well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves: <hi>If any one,</hi> ſays he, <hi>does not find ſo frequent,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:38446:170"/>or ſo violent motions of Anger, Envy, Impurity, or of other like paſſions, let him give thanks to the body and blood of our Lord; for it is the vertue of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which produces in him theſe effects: and let him rejoyce, that the worſt of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers begin to heal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the Holy Euchariſt gives perſeverance in the grace of God, and in the way of Salvation, in the midſt of the various &amp; imminent dangers, which we encounter in this Life, and particularly when we draw near death; whence it was given ſometimes to Martyrs when they were ready to ſuffer for the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and the Church always takes care to Communicate the ſick, when they are in danger of Death, that ſo they may be Strengthened in that dangerous paſſage, and happily arrive at the haven of Salvation by means of this divine nouriſhment, then called the <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, the Proviſion for that voiage.</p>
                     <p>All theſe admirable effects evidently prove the greatneſs and excellence of this divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and ought effectually to move us fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to approach unto it, and not neglect ſo many and ſo ſignal favours, as God there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents unto us. Yet we are to take notice, that it doth not produce theſe Effects, except in ſuch perſons, as are rightly diſpoſed to receive it, as it deſerves.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe diſpoſitions we will now diſcourſe.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICLE IV.</hi> Of the diſpoſitions required to Communicate well and as we ought.</head>
                     <p>WE ſhall inferr the diſpoſitions from the ſame principle, from which we gathered the effects, <hi>viz.</hi> from the nature of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Spiritual food we receive in the Holy Euchriſt: and as it produces the ſame effects in the Soul, that food doth into the Body, ſo alſo it requives proportionable diſpoſitions in the Soul, that nouriſhment doth to be beneficial to the Body.</p>
                     <p>Now Corporall nouriſhment, we know re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires three diſpoſitions, <hi>Life, Health,</hi> &amp; <hi>Action;</hi> for a dead body is uncapable to be nouriſhed, an infirm Stomack can never make a good digeſtion, nor is it poſſible to convert the food into our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance except that health be accompanied with our action; which is the reaſon, that the body to be nouriſhed requires to be alive, to be ſound and well, and to have an action of its own.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Euchariſt, that Celeſtiall food re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires three diſpoſitions in the Soul, and without them it doth no good, but harm.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is Sanctifying Grace, which is the life of the Soul, as mortall Sin is the death incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with it, depriving us of this Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life of the Soul: Without this life the Soul not only receives no benefit from Communion, but ſuffers alſo much detriment from this holy Table; inofmuch as ſhe becomes guilty of a new
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:38446:171"/>mortall Sin, a Sacriledge, which ſhe commits by inviting the Authour of Life into the habitation of Death, the author of Light into the place of Darkneſs; and Jeſus Chriſt into the company of the Devil. This made St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 21.28. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe all Communicants to examen themſelves well, when they approach to this holy table; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>he who eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second diſpoſition is the interiour <hi>Health</hi> of the Soul, which requires 1ſt, that ſhe be free from any affection to veniall Sin. 2ly. that ſhe be not actually moved either with Paſſions or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which may hinder her in her applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and addreſs to Jeſus Chriſt. And altho' theſe defects do not render the Communicant ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unworthy, or the Communion Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, yet they cauſe very ill effects and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diminiſh the fruits, which otherwiſe it would produce. They hinder the Soul from digeſting this ſacred food by good thoughts and holy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And as nutriment, which lies indigeſted upon the Stomack, begets crudities, and cauſes Sickneſs in the body; ſo this divine ſuſtenance by means of theſe indiſpoſitions becomes preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Soul. Thereby we contract tepidity and coldneſs in devotion, Charity and other Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are conſiderably diminiſh'd, our good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons weak and feeble, our ſelves by degrees inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of all good things which conduce to Piety. And thus by degrees at laſt we are often brought into mortall Sin.</p>
                     <p>The Third diſpoſition is <hi>Action,</hi> that is actual devotion. To receive the fruits of this Sacrament, it is not ſufficient that we be not indiſpoſed, or
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:38446:172"/>that we do not put any obſtacle to its effects; it is neceſſary alſo that in this ſo religious an action, wherein we receive the Holy of Holys, and the Author of Holineſs it ſelf, we concur with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of our own; which conſiſt in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chriſtian Virtues. Of which we ſhall ſpeak below in the <hi>Second Part</hi> of this Inſtruction.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICLE V.</hi> Of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy Communion.</head>
                     <p>AN ancient Lawgiver being ask'd why he had made no Laws againſt Paricides, made anſwer, becauſe he eſteemed that crime impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that there could not be found Children, ſo degenerate and unnaturall, as to attempt the life of their own Parents.</p>
                     <p>I would to God we could ſay the ſame with truth in the point of Inſtruction concerning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Communion, or that we could truly ſay that it is not neceſſary to advertiſe Chriſtians to avoid that ſo horrid Sacriledge, becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a man profeſſing himſelf a Chriſtian ever to be guilty of ſo enormous a crime againſt our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But Alas! the contrary is too true: and this crime tho' a thouſand times greater, yet is much more common amongſt Chriſtians then that of Paricide: They have an horror (and with good reaſon) to deprive thoſe of breath, from whom they receiv'd their life; yet they are not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive to Murder and Crucifie again, as much as in them lies, our Saviour Chriſt, by receiving
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:38446:172"/>him into an impure &amp; perfidious Breaſt. Nature hath imprinted in them a profound and laſting reſpect for thoſe from whom they have received only a Mortal and fading life; But they eaſily forget the Reverence they owe to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> notwithſtanding he nouriſheth them with his own ſubſtance, his pretious <hi>Blood,</hi> and offers them by his preſence a Spiritual and immortal, and a pledge of everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>O God, <hi>Theotime,</hi> is it poſsible then that there ſhould be found Souls capable of ſo black a deed, ſo horrible a Crime? Surely they are only thoſe, who either have no Faith; or ſuch as have never conſidered the enormity of the Sin, who can commit it; for he muſt ſurpaſs the very Devils in malice, who falls into ſuch a Sin, if he have but the leaſt knowledge, how grievous and great it is; and what dreadfull conſequences do follow from it. Two points I therefore deſign to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of in this place.</p>
                     <p>I will ſet forth the enormity of this Sin from three heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From that remarkable ſaying of our Lord himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Do not give that which is Holy unto Dogs.</hi> If it be a great Sacrilege to give to Dogs things conſecrated to God; what Crime muſt it needs be to give the Holy of Holies unto a Soul an enemy of God, more impure and filthy then the very Dogs? and what Sin muſt it be in thoſe to receive the Body of our Lord, who being no better then Dogs, as it is ſaid in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypſe,</hi> and under this notion excluded from the Sanctuary: <hi>Foris canes &amp; impudici,</hi> yet have the impudence to eat <hi>the Bread of Children, the Bread of the very Angels themſelves. Ecce panis Angelorum,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:38446:173"/>vere panis filioram non mittendus canibus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. From that ſo famed Doctrine and ſignal admonition of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Whoſoever ones the Bread, and drinks the Chalice of our Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> This Sentence is a Thunder, which ought to terrify all thoſe who are ſo miſerably unfortumate as to Communicate in Mortal Sin: For he ſaith they <hi>are guilty of the Body and Blood</hi> of the Son of God: that is, they deſpiſe and treat in juriouſly this adorable Body and Blood, whilſt they receive it in a profane place, in the Temple of Satan, in a Soul polluted with Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin.</p>
                     <p>It is particularly verified in this occaſion what St. <hi>Paul</hi> relates elſewhere, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. this is to Cruciſy <hi>Jeſus Chriſt again;</hi> to ſcoff at him, to trample him under ones feet, and contemn his Blood in that very action by which one ought to ſanctify his holy name. Can we think of theſe things without trembling and horror? We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver call to mind without a certain horror and everſion the inhumane methods the <hi>Jews</hi> and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diets a ſed againſt our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the time of his bitter Paſſion; and can we be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible in our own caſe, as not to deteſt thoſe affronts we offer him even worſe then the <hi>Jews</hi> did whilſt we unworthily receive him? For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that they <hi>Luo.</hi> 23.34. knew not what they did; we know and confeſs him to be the Son of God, whom we offend.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> explaining theſe words of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat the Bread or drink the Cup of our Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of our Lord. Why ſo?</hi> ſuith
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:38446:173"/>this Holy Father, <hi>hom.</hi> 27. and his anſwer is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſpilt the Blood, and by that action he hath not offered a Sacrifice, but committed a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he who approaches unworthily to this Divine Table and receives no Fruit from thence, reſembles them, who formerly pierced the Body of our Lord, not to drink but to ſhed his Blood.</hi> And, <hi>hom.</hi> 60. <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what juſt Indignation you conceive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him who betrayed</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and againſt thoſe who Crucified him: therefore conſider leſt you alſo be equally culpable and guilty of the Body and Blood of the Son of God. It is true, they kill'd his moſt Sacred Body, but you after ſo many and ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated benefits beſtowed upon you, receive him into an unclean and polluted Soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> before him had ſaid that unworthy Communicants offer Violence to the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that this ſin is a more grievous offence in the ſight of God, then it is for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to abjure him in the preſence of Infidels.</p>
                     <p>The Third from hence, which you ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to forget, that the ſin of an unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is the ſin of <hi>Judas.</hi> It was he who firſt committed it, and thoſe who fall into it ſince imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his Example and become his Diſciples. They receive him, as he did, in a Criminall and guilty Soul: They betray him not indeed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but which is worſe to the Devil, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits in them. What puniſhment ought they not to dread from ſuch an Enormous Crime? Ought they not to remember how that perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Apoſtle was immediately poſſeſſed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the moment, that be received <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> for ſince they imitate him in his Sin, they cannot avoid being partaker of his puniſhment, as we are about to ſhew you.</p>

                        <p>SUch a miſchievous cauſe cannot but produce moſt fatal effects.</p>
                        <p>The death of the Soul, which infallibly it brings with it, is the firſt evil which follows from it: <hi>Mors eſt malis, vita bonis.</hi> This death is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or extenſion of that other, wherein the Soul lay buried before by the Sin in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Sacrament: It is a further baniſhment from the grace of God, and a further diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and expoſing her to the Power of Satan.</p>
                        <p>From this Death follow other moſt diſmal &amp; lamentable effects: as the fall into new Sins; the blindneſs of Spirit; the encreaſe of vices and paſsions, which makes a Soul to groan under the Yoke of her Captivity, and hinder her from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again to God by true Repentance.</p>
                        <p>The Prophet hath compriſed theſe effects in few words, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 68.23. when ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemies of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he prays to God, <hi>that their Table may prove a ſnare to them, and an occaſion of ſcandal: That they may become blind, ſo that they may not ſee their own good: That they may always ſtoop under the Yoke of a miſerable Servitude.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If thoſe, who perſecuted <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> without knowing him, are puniſhed ſo ſeverely, what ought not Chriſtians to expect, when they treat him ſo ill in his own Perſon whom they know?</p>
                        <p>Hiſtories are full of examples of divers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which God hath laid upon this ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtabie a Sin.</p>

                        <p>Saint <hi>Cyprian delapſis,</hi> affirms that in his time there were many, whoſe bodies were delivered over to be poſſeſs'd by the Devil, for that they had Communicated unworthily; and alſo that many had loſt their judgment, and become diſtracted and mad upon the ſame account.</p>
                        <p>And Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> alſo aſſures us that the ſame thing happen'd in his time.</p>
                        <p>The ſame St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> reports that a Chriſtian woman having partaken in private of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Idols, and coming not long after to Communicate with the Chriſtians, ſhe had no ſooner received the Son of God, but ſhe found her ſelf tormented, as if ſhe had taken poyſon, and dyed in the preſence of all there.</p>
                        <p>He ſpeaks of another who being willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the precious body of the Son of God, her ſelf being in an evil ſtate, as ſhe open'd the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in which it was encloſed, there iſſued out a flame of fire, which hindred her, ſo that ſhe was not able to receive it. And another Chriſtian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to do the ſame, inſtead of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated hoſt, which he expected to have found in the place, where he had reſerved it, he found nothing elſe but aſhes.</p>
                        <p>He himſelf alſo recounts this Paſſage, how that a little Child, to whom his Pagan nurſe had caus'd a little wine conſecrated to the Idols to be given, being afterwards carried by his mother unto the Church at the time of the holy Sacrifice of the Maſs, was not able to ſwallow one drop of the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:38446:175"/>conſecrated wine, which the Deacon had put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mouth. <hi>The Sacred Euchariſt,</hi> ſaith this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, ibid. <hi>could not endure to ſtay in a body and mouth defiled and profaned,</hi> by the only touch of a forbidden drink.

                        <p>I could relate a vaſt number of other examples; but it would be too long &amp; tedious, &amp; theſe are ſufficient to make every one reflect, as the ſame St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> conſiders, that if he have not as yet received the ſame puniſhment for his unworthy Communion (if he have been guilty of it) he hath nevertheleſs deſerv'd it, as much as they. <hi>Let every one conſider,</hi> ſaith this Holy Father, <hi>not ſo much the puniſhment, which another hath received, as what he himſelf hath deſerved; and that he do not believe he hath avoided the chaſtiſement, becauſe as yet it is ſomething delayed; ſince he ought rather to be much more afraid, to whom God in his juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath deferred the puniſhment of his Sins to a longer time.</hi>

                     <p>BEſides the purity of Conſcience, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that we have that of rectitude of Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Communicate well: for it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that an action how good ſoever it may be in it ſelf, looſeth its worth and value by the default of a good Intention: and it becomes evil and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:38446:175"/>if the Intention be ſuch, and if it be done for an evil end.</p>
                     <p>This being true in all good actions, whatſoever, it is ſtill much more in this of Communion; foraſmuch as it is certain, that nothing, but what is pure and holy, ought to draw near and receive purity and holyneſs it ſelf: and that it is a contempt of the greatneſs and ſanctity of God, to approach unto him upon any other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, then that of pleaſing him and meriting his grace and favour.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon in the Old Teſtament it was his will that none ſhould ſerve himſelf upon his Altar of any other then Holy Fire, which he had ordained for the uſe of the Sacrifices: And he puniſhed with ſudden death the two Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who were ſo raſh as there to make uſe of Prophane Fire; by this figure we learn, that for one to approach unto him, it is not ſufficient to be holy, but it is alſo neceſſary that one bring with him an Intention altogether pure and holy, and that an evil and Prophane Intention doth grievouſly offend him upon this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>We muſt then approach unto the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with an Intention totally pure, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to our ſelves an end altogether holy in this ſo great and ſo auguſt an action: Now that we may perform this duty, two things are neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that one propoſe to himſelf no evil thing, as the motive and cauſe of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; as Hypocriſy, to diſſemble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal ſome fault with an appearance of Piety; Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to be eſteemed virtuous; Humane reſpect, leſt he ſhould diſpleaſe any one, or to pleaſe men rather then God. Theſe three motives are but
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:38446:176"/>too frequent amongſt thoſe, who are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtructed concerning the Intention, which we ought to have in our Communion, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly among young People. Wherefore they ought to have ſpecial care to avoid them. The firſt is the greateſt fault, and ordinarily ſpeaking renders the Communion Sacrilegious, the other two deprives one of the beſt part of the fruit, it otherwiſe would produce.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This intention muſt be directed to the Service of God, and our Salvation. to God, to pleaſe him the more, and to unite our ſelves thereby more ſtrictly to him; to our Salvation, to promote it by obtaining by means of the Holy Communion the Graces, which we ſtand moſt in need of, as to amend our faults, to reſiſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; to fix and confirm us more in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Virtues.</p>
                     <p>The two ends we find in our Lords prayer; where the three firſt Petitions contain what we can wiſh, for the greater honour and glory of God; and the other four comprehend, what is neceſſary for our Salvation. And it is a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable exerciſe to propoſe to our ſelves for the end of our Communion, the obtaining of the grace of God, for the accompliſhment of the Seven demands, which make up, &amp; compoſe it, or of which this divine Prayer conſiſts.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo good to add to this general intention, ſome particular end, according to our preſent neceſſities; as to obtain ſome particular grace we ſtand in need of, to correct in our ſelves ſome fault, and to advance in ſome particular Virtue.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The right and Religious intention,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:38446:176"/>which we ought to have in Communion, is the very ſame, which Chriſt propoſed to himſelf, when he firſt inſtituted this divine Sacrament. Now his intention was, as he himſelf declared, <hi>that he might remain in us, and we in him.</hi> He dwells in us by his Grace, and the aſſiſtance of his holy Inſpirations; and we remain in him by love, and the obedience we render to him: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to your ſelf this end, and you ſhall Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate according to the Intention and Will of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>PART II.</hi> Of the Practice of Communion, Or, What we muſt do to Communicate well, and as we ought.</head>
               <p>NExt to the purity of Conſcience, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of Intention, both which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Communicate worthily, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid; there remains a third diſpoſition, that we may Communicate with more Fruit, and get a larger portion of his grace; and it is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Devotion, which we ought to have when we Communicate.</p>
               <p>There are almoſt infinite ways to practice this devotion, which ſeveral Books teach in ſeveral manners: But I am perſuaded, there is none more profitable, and at the ſame time more ſolid, then that which is reduced to the practice of the three Theological Virtues, Faith, Hope, &amp; Charity.</p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:38446:177"/>
               <p>Theſe three comprehend the practice of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian Virtues: And as it is neceſſary that our Souls be poſſeſſors of them to be in a condition to Communicate worthily and as we ought, that is in the State of Grace: One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better receive <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor afford him a more gratefull entertainment, then if, when he actually Communicates, he practice the acts of theſe three great and Divine Virtues, as we ſhall ſhew in the three following Chapters.</p>
               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Faith inaſmuch as it ſerves for Communion.</head>

                     <head>
                        <hi>ARTICLE I.</hi> How neceſſary it is, and in what manner.</head>
                     <p>WE have already declar'd in the firſt part, that Faith is a gift of God, by which we believe the truth, which he hath revealed unto us. And this makes us to remark a diſtinction, which we muſt obſerve, as well in this virtue, as in the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> betwixt Faith, as it is a Virtue, and the ſame as it is an Action.</p>
                     <p>The Virtue of faith is that interiour light, which is given us by God, that we may know and believe the truth.</p>
                     <p>The Action or act, is the actuall credit or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which we give to the truth revealed, when we ſay, I believe this truth.</p>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:38446:177"/>
                     <p>The One and the Other are neceſſary for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, whoſoever is not endowed with faith as it is a Virtue, is an unworthy Communicant, and he that approaches to the Communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Act of faith, ſhall not receive the fruits thereof.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt difficulty we find in this place is not in having the Virtue of faith; for all thoſe, who are baptized, have received this in Baptiſme; and they conſerve it ſtill, except they have loſt it either by misbelief or any willfull doubt. In which caſe it muſt be repaired by believing, and doing penance.</p>
                     <p>But as to what concerns the acts of faith, they require an application of the mind and heart, to practice them as we ought, that is to ſay, with neceſſary knowledge and the conſtancy, which is fit: Whereof we are about to treat.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="article">
                     <head>
                        <hi>ARTICLE II.</hi> That to Communicate well it is not ſufficient to have Faith, but we muſt practice the Acts thereof, and how profitable they are in Communion.</head>
                     <p>WHoſoever then is without Faith, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Communicant, ſince <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> as the Apoſtle affirms <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. and he that doth not pleaſe God, cannot be worthy to receive.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo neceſſary to have faith not only of all the miſteries of our Religion, but we muſt have it in particular of this here, and it is required that we have made acts of faith, which we have
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:38446:178"/>never revoked, nor changed.</p>
                     <p>But I ſay moreover that to receive the benefit of Communion, we muſt practice the Acts of this Faith before, at the time, and after Communion; and that the chiefeſt fruit of this grand and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant action depends upon the punctuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the acts of theſe three virtues, of Faith, of Hope, and of Charity.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon is very obvious; for it is certain that the Sacraments work their effects proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to the meaſure of the diſpoſition of the receiver; and that they give a far greater plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of graces to thoſe, who are interiourly bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſed, and render themſelves more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of them: Now this perfecter preparation of the heart is made by the acts of Chriſtian virtues, &amp; particularly by thoſe of Faith, Hope, &amp; Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are the firſt in dignity, and contain all the reſt. That which St. <hi>Cyprian Epiſt. ad Don.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms of the Sacrament of Baptiſm is verified in all the others, but more eſpecially in that of the Holy Euchariſt: <hi>That we draw from thence more grace according to the greatneſs and capacity of the Faith we bring with us to receive: One needs no more then ardently to deſire it, and open his heart to God, and give him room to fill it. Quantum illic fidei capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis afferimus, tantum gratiae inundantis haurimus; noſtrum tantum ſitiat pectus &amp; pateat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where it is to be obſerved, that this Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in theſe excellent words points at the three Virtues, we have already ſpoke of. He ſaith, that with this ſtrong Faith it is neceſſary that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the grace of God, and open our hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Now we deſire by Hope; and we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our hearts by Charity and the love of God.</p>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:38446:178"/>
                     <p>Moreover let us add as the proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reaſon in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, that it is a Celeſtial Banquet wherein we receive the nouriſhment of our Souls. Now who is there, but he knows, that Meat, except it be eaten with a good appetite, and with a ſtomach well diſpoſed to digeſt the food by its natural heat, and change it into its own ſubſtance, doth little good? This is yet more certain in Spiritual nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, which requires not either leſs action or co-operation and concurrence of our Soul on our ſide, to benefit it as we ought. And without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion we need not ſeek for any other cauſes of the ſmall advantage we draw from our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, altho' otherwiſe we receive in the State of Grace, then the coldneſs and indevotion with which we perform this duty; which ſtops the hands of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and hinders him from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting his favours to thoſe, who receive him with ſo much indifference, and ſo unconcerned.</p>
                     <p>If this reaſon were not ſufficiently efficacious, I ſhould add alſo, (without leaving the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Feaſt) that we ought indeed to come cloath'd with the Nuptial Garment (that is with Sanctifying Grace) to this Sacred Banquet of Holy Communion; but this ought not to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or be enough for thoſe, who deſire to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the advantage, they are capable to receive from thence: for to let this ſuffice, would be, as if a man being invited to a Feaſt by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality, ſhould content himſelf to go thither well cloath'd, and in his beſt Apparel; but when he comes, ſhould refuſe to diſcourſe with him, or ſpeak one word.</p>
                     <p>What ſhould we ſay of ſuch an action as this?
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:38446:179"/>Had we not juſt cauſe to judge that this Perſon had but little regard or eſteem for him whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited Gueſt he was? and that he contemned or at leaſt ſlighted his friendſhip, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favours, which he might receive at his hands? and yet this is what you your ſelf are guilty of, <hi>Theotime,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when you Communicate unconcerned, careleſly, with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and indevotion.</p>
                     <p>Remember, I beſeech you, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to pleaſe our Lord to receive him in this manner, and that you looſe innumerable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by this your ſo ſignally cold reception of him.</p>
                     <p>Conſider how ill this correſponds with that preſſing and ardent love, with which he invites you to this Feaſt, and with that earneſt deſire he hath to receive you there, ſaying to you now, what formerly he did to his Diſciples. <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.15. <hi>I have moſt earneſtly deſired to eat this Paſſover with you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus when he invites a Soul unto him, he doth not only require, that ſhe appear in his preſence, but he expects, that ſhe ſhould make him to hear and underſtand her voice. <hi>Come,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>my dear and well beloved Soul, ſhew me thy face, let me hear thy voice; for thy voice is ſweet and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, as thy countenance is beautifull and comely.</hi> By the face, he gives us to underſtand the beauty of the Soul, which conſiſts in Sanctifying grace, and the Ornaments of the Virtues; and by the Voice he points at the acts of theſe ſame Virtues, which make a confort and harmony moſt pleaſing and agreeable in the ſight of God.</p>

                     <p>Exerciſe your Faith upon theſe three points, when you communicate; but ſee that they be acts of a ſtedfaſt and fervent faith; and for the eaſier performance of them, ponder and detain your ſelf upon the two firſt, before Communion; and entertain your thoughts upon the third, which are the effects after Communion, in the following manner.</p>

                        <p>I believe this truth upon the aſſurance of thy holy words, and upon the authority of thy holy Church, which thus teaches me to believe.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>ARTICLE I.</hi> What is Hope?</head>
                     <p>IT is the Second of the three Theological Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſo called, becauſe they reſpect God not only as their motive and their end, (as all other Chriſtian Virtues do) but alſo as their firſt and principal object.</p>
                     <p>To expect from the hand of God, the things he hath promiſed us, and which he hath prepar'd for his Servants, is the proper effect of this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; wherefore it is defined a certain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Eternal bliſs, and of the means to attain unto it.</p>
                     <p>This expectation is the proper act of this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Hope; which is a certain judgment which we form, that God will be pleaſed to grant us Everlaſting Life, if we correſpond with his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and be Faithfull in the Diſpenſations he hath
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:38446:184"/>commended to us; for as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> obſerves very well; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. <hi>Serm.</hi> 10. <hi>Faith tells us that there are great rewards prepared for Gods Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Servants: Hope</hi> ſays, <hi>that theſe are reſerved for me. Charity</hi> is the third, and ſaith, <hi>I run that I may reach to them, and enjoy them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is of this expectation, which the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Thren.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Our Lord is my portion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will expect him.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.2. when he aſſures us, <hi>that he glories in the hope of the glory,</hi> or happineſs <hi>of the Children of God;</hi> and when he exhorts all Chriſtians to a good Life, <hi>Expecting,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. <hi>the bleſſed hope and coming of the glory of our great God, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This hope is certain and ſecure, in as much as it is built upon Gods promiſe, who can never fail of his word, having both a will and a power to perform, whatſoever he is pleaſed to promiſe; This made the ſame Apoſtle affirm, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. that <hi>he knew very well in whom he had put his truſt, and that he was altogether aſſur'd of the power he had</hi> in effect <hi>to fullfill his promiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But whereas theſe divine promiſes are only conditional, and made only to ſuch, who are his Faithfull Servants, our hope ought alſo always to ſuppoſe this condition of our Fidelity, and thus the certainty ought always to be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with a holy diſtruſt or diſconfidence in our ſelves, which makes us work our Salvation with fear and trembling, and as St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath it, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Secure our Vocation and Election by good works.</hi>

                        <hi>ARTICLE. II.</hi> Of the good which we expect by Hope.</head>
                     <p>TWo goods there are we expect, Grace, and Glory; this is the end, which is prepared for us, and that is the means, whereby to obtain that end; God comporting himſelf, if I may ſay ſo, in this our great concern, like a good equally and a wiſe Father, whoſe goodneſs obliges him to prepare an Inheritance for his Children, and whoſe Wiſdom finds out means, whereby they may come to the poſſeſſion of it.</p>
                     <p>Glory ſhall be our ſupream and final happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein our Soul ſhall ſee God as he is in himſelf face to face, and thence conceive ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and perfect a love of him, that every the leaſt vacancy of the Soul ſhall be fill'd with an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible joy; and an happineſs, that ſhall not receive either the leaſt alteration or any end.</p>
                     <p>Even our body ſhall have its ſhare in this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory: For after the Reſurrection the glorious ſplendors of the bleſſed Soul, united to the body, ſhall by the reflection of her rays ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it not only immortall, but diſcharge it alſo from all poſſibility of change, endowing it with the four qualities, which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. (in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that queſtion <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>how do the dead riſe again? and with what kind of body ſhall they come?</hi>) hath diſcovered to us, Impaſſibility <hi>v.</hi> 42. Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty 43. Agility <hi>ibid.</hi> Subtility 44. The firſt is a bleſſed <hi>incorruption,</hi> which ſhall exempt us, and render us incapable of all either pain or grief;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:38446:185"/>The ſecond a <hi>Glory,</hi> whereby it ſhall become ſo bright, as not only to vye with, but to ſurpaſs the Sun; The third is an active <hi>Power</hi> or ſtrength by which it ſhall paſs in an Inſtant at the beck of her will, whereſoever ſhe pleaſeth, without the leaſt trouble; and by the fourth, as a <hi>Spirit,</hi> it ſhall penetrate and paſs thro' the moſt ſolid body without any impediment or let.</p>
                     <p>Behold what we expect after this life both for our Soul and bodies.</p>
                     <p>And as to what concerns this preſent life, we expect from the hands of God the means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may obtain this ſo happy end: foraſmuch as of our ſelves, and by all our naturall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, though never ſo great, left to our ſelves, we are not able to arrive unto it.</p>
                     <p>This end inaſmuch as it is a ſupernaturall good, requires in our Soul a diſpoſition of the ſame nature with it; &amp; this is Sanctifying Grace, the ſeed of <hi>Glory,</hi> and the precious pledge of that Eternall Inheritance, as the Apoſtle hath it, ſpeaking thus to the <hi>Epheſians. c.</hi> 1.13. <hi>You are ſign'd with the holy Spirit of promiſe, which is the pledge of our Inheritance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Grace is a Supernaturall quality infuſed by God into our Soul at the inſtant he admits us into his freindſhip; a quality which remits the Sin, Sanctifies the Soul, embelliſhes, and renders her acceptable to God, and gives her a certain right to eternall glory: <hi>That Juſtified by</hi> his grace we may be heirs according to hope of <hi>Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life.</hi> Tit. 3.7.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince this grace, this diſpoſition to glory, is alſo Supernatural, it is neceſſary we have the aſſiſtance of ſome powerfull hand to obtain it,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:38446:185"/>and this can be no other then the hand of God, as there is none but God alone, who can endow the Soul with Sanctifying Grace.</p>
                     <p>This aſſiſtance is alſo called grace, becauſe it is graciouſly, and out of Gods pure mercy, beſtow'd upon us; but it is called actuall, as the other is ſtil'd habituall grace, becauſe it is tranſient on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not permanent as Sanctifying grace, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is; it is that action by which God moves the powers of our Soul, our underſtanding &amp; will; diſpoſing her to her juſtification; &amp; this by clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her underſtanding, and letting her ſee, what chiefly concerns her, by good thoughts, which he beſtows upon her; &amp; moving her will to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that good ſhe ſees ſo much imports her, by the holy affections, which he vouchſafes to give her.</p>
                     <p>Theſe helps have three effects in us. For firſt, they awake our Soul by interiour illuminations, and religious motions oblige her to look ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after her Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. Once ſhe is thus moved, it aſſiſts her in the due performance of that good, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd unto her, &amp; gives her ſtrength to raiſe her ſelf up to God by acts of Faith, Hope, Contrition, and the love of God; all which diſpoſe her to receive at the ſame time the remiſſion of her Sins and juſtifying Grace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly. As ſoon as ſhe has received this grace, theſe helps afford her ſtill more ſtrength to ſtand faſt and conſerve her ſelf amongſt the throng of temptations, and to perſever conſtant even to the end by her flight from evill, and the frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of good and pious works.</p>
                     <p>Hence proceed the different names, by which we call this actuall grace: for the firſt we call
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:38446:186"/>Exciting, Operating or Preventing grace: the 2d. Aſsiſting or Cooperating grace, the 3d the grace of Perſeverance. God hath beſtowed upon us all theſe graces for our Salvation: But we are to obſerve that they have not always their full and entire effect upon the will; for ſhe being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mov'd and preſs'd, and not neceſsitated by the graces, may either reſiſt or not regard them, according as the Councill of <hi>Trent, ſeſſ.</hi> 6. c. 5. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks: nay very often doth reſiſt; for we are adviſed in holy writ, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.9. not to harden our hearts, &amp; yet however we do harden them; for frequently we do not hearken to the voice of God, but reſiſt his holy ſpirit, as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. that the <hi>Jews</hi> did.</p>
                     <p>This advertiſement may ſerve in this place to teach us an important truth, that it is not enough to expect from the hands of God the means, whereby we may compaſs our Salvation; but that we ought to take great care to be faithfull to his diſpenſations, and carefully cooperate with his grace, and alſo that we ought dayly to begg of him, that he will vouchſafe to continue &amp; reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our hearts therewith; leſt by our Sins we render our ſelves unworthy of them.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICLE III.</hi> That it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh well betwixt True and Falſe, Good and Bad Hope.</head>
                     <p>THis diſtinction is of the higheſt importance; for as much as the greateſt part of the world deceive themſelves therein, taking falſe for true,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:38446:186"/>and embracing an evill and ſinfull, inſtead of a good and virtuous Hope; and from this miſtake proceeds the damnation of innumerable Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. There is no one but hopes to be ſaved, but becauſe their hopes are ill grounded, &amp; they hope other wiſe then they ought, they lull themſelves aſleep in this fooliſh hope, and approaching to their end, they find themſelves upon the brink of a precipice, when they imagined they were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into the port, and ſtood upon firm land.</p>
                     <p>Such is their Hope, who expect Salvation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they do not uſe the means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; and who living ill hope to dy well: now how many are there of theſe? and what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are herein deceived?</p>
                     <p>Such is their hope, who believe indeed that it is neceſſary for Salvation to live a good and virtuous life; but ſtill defer their converſion, thinking that God will allways expect them, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he hath done, with patience to repentance, notwithſtanding their wicked courſe of life, and the perpetuall abuſes, which they never ceaſe to offer to his graces.</p>
                     <p>Such is their hope, who Sin upon account of the confidence they have of Pardon: and who are wont to ſay, when they have offended, that Gods mercy is great, and that he will forget their Sins.</p>
                     <p>Such is their hope, who imagine they ſhall be converted and return to God, whenſoere they pleaſe: or that his grace will be allways in their power; or that, let them do what they will, it will never forſake them.</p>
                     <p>Such is their hope, who willfully and by ſome ſignall negligence of theirs expoſe themſelves to the immediate occaſions of Sin, in hopes that God will preſerve them.</p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:38446:187"/>
                     <p>Such is the hope of many cold and negligent, tho' otherwiſe juſt people, who relying upon a certain confidence of working their Salvation without much trouble, ſuffer themſelves to ſleep, frequenting remiſsly or ſeldom the means, which God hath been pleaſed to grant us, as moſt proper to conſerve &amp; encreaſe in us his Grace; ſuch as are Prayer, the Sacraments, and good Works.</p>
                     <p>All theſe hopes are falſe and deceitfull; and like falſe lights lead them into a precipice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of conducting them into the Port, their Salvation.</p>
                     <p>A man Endowed with Hope, which is good and true, expects, not only from the hand of God the performances of his promiſe, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo expects that this ſhall be done in the manner God hath promiſed: He hopes to be partaker of the goods of Glory, but not except he ſerve him with fidelity, as he hath promiſed thoſe, who ſhall ſerve him, who ſhall be faithfull in complying with the graces diſpens'd unto him, and ſhall perſevere therein, unto the end.</p>
                     <p>He expects in this life the goods of Grace, thereby to obtain that of glory; but endeavours at the ſame time not to put any obſtacle or let on his ſide to the workings of it: He demands them with much fervour and humility, he hath a care to comply ſincerely with them. If he be in ſin, he doth Penance without delay; but never offends in hopes of doing Penance, and (as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> adviſes) he is <hi>fearfull to commit a ſin, which he doth not know whether or no he ſhall ever be ſufficiently able to deplore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a word a man who truly hopes, walks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the midſt between confidence and fear: he
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:38446:187"/>truſts in God, and miſtruſts himſelf. He hopes that God will not reject him, but he fears leſt himſelf ſhould forſake his God: he hopes that God will aſſiſt him; but fears leſt himſelf prove unfaithfull or defective in his duty. And thus between this confidence and fear humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the preſence of God, he prays, he labours, endeavouring to ſecure his Salvation on the one ſide by flying from Sin, and all the occaſions of it, and on the other by a due performance of good works.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, Hope conſiſts in, or is at leaſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with, theſe four acts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A confidence to obtain from the divine goodneſs Everlaſting life, with all the graces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to acquire it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A vehement deſire of Salvation: for the expectation, which we have, of any great good, is apt to raiſe in us an ardent &amp; great deſire of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A fear to loſe it by our fault, or any infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of ours; a fear which ought not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any diſquiet in the Soul, but the hatred of ſin, which only can make us loſe it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A firm, and that an efficacious reſolution to labour for Salvation, a Reſolution, which makes one act, and employ the means neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that end, as is aboveſaid.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, It makes her love and deſire Heaven, her dear Country, her native Soil: it makes her ſigh after her Eternal happyneſs; it makes her fear, leſt ſhe be fruſtrated of it by her fault, and loſe her ſelf among the dangers of this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Life, ſo full of Rocks whereon Salvation ſo often ſuffers Shipwrack.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It makes her love the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which hath prepared ſo great bleſſings for her, and hath put into her hands the means to acquire them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It makes her contemn this preſent life: it diſengageth her from the love of theſe goods, and pleaſures, making her look upon them, as tranſitory things, which paſs like a ſhaddow, and yet which are not obtained but with much trouble, nor poſſeſſed without ſolicitude, nor loſt without great grief.</p>
                     <p>It is for this reaſon that the juſt Man accounts himſelf in this life no otherwiſe then as a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim or Traveller upon his way to his Native ſoil, knowing well, as St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 13.14. ſaith, that <hi>here we have no permanent City,</hi> or abode, <hi>but we ſeek that which is to come,</hi> after this life.

                     <p>And St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> obſerves excellently well, that God by his Wiſdom hath mingled afflictions and bitterneſs with all the even moſt innocent
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:38446:188"/>goods of this life, ſo to diſengage us from the affection to them, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>Docetur amare me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liora per amaritudinem inferiorum: ne viator tendens ad patriam, ſtabulum amet pro domo ſua: Leſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Man, who is a Traveller upon his way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, taking his pleaſure in this Life, ſhould love his Inn better then his own Houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This Hope makes the Juſt Man labour for his Salvation, and becoming daily better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter render himſelf worthy of his heavenly voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.3.) <hi>Every one who hath this hope in God doth Sanctify himſelf, as God is holy.</hi> This hope gives him ſtrength to conquer all difficulties; and wings to fly in the way of Gods commandments, as the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> 40.31. ſpeaks, <hi>They who hope in God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſhall change their ſtrength, that is, receive a new force; they ſhall have wings as an Angel: they ſhall run with eaſe, they ſhall travel without failing by the way.</hi>

                        <hi>5ly.</hi> This ſame Hope encourageth us in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it gives us ſtrength to encounter them. For what greater encouragement can there be in theſe occaſions, then to know that God is with us: that he aſſiſts us in the fight, and gives us ſtrength to overcome; and that he hath prepared an eternal reward for thoſe that conquer. He whoſe heart is repleniſhed with Hope, doth he not ſay with <hi>David</hi> whenſoever he is tempted? <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22.4. <hi>O my God I will not be afraid of any harm being thou art with me,</hi> Pſ. 26.1. <hi>Our Lord is my light and my Salvation, whom ſhould I fear?</hi> v. 3. <hi>If war ſhall be rais'd againſt me I will hope in him,</hi> Pſ. 7.1. <hi>O Lord I hope in thee, ſave me, and deliver me from all my perſecutors.</hi> For this reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. calls hope the Helmet of Chriſtians. <hi>Take</hi> ſays
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:38446:189"/>he, <hi>for thy helmet the hope of Salvation:</hi> For as a head-peice, it preſerves us from the blows of the enemy, and the mortall wounds which he endea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vours to give us.</p>
                     <p>In fine Hope guards us excellently well, and is of infinite uſe in afflictions, of which this mortall life is full. Herein it is that we find our refuge, our comfort, and our ſtrength: when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with attention that theſe miſeries cannot laſt always, they will have an end, and will be followed with an eternall joy, if we ſuffer them with patience; as it is but fit and juſt we ſhould. And when we ponder well upon thoſe excellent words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 4.17. wherein he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, <hi>That the momentary and light afflictions, which we at preſent endure, work exceedingly above meaſure a weight of unconceivable glory and happineſs which ſhall never end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is then, when after the example of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Apoſtle, we ſhall rejoyce and eſteem our ſelves happy in our afflictions, being aſſured of this truth wherein he affirms. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. that <hi>Affliction cauſeth Patience, Patience trys our ſtrength; this tryall confirms our Hopes, and Hope will never confound us,</hi> ſo as to permit our expectations to be fruſtrate. Wherefore the ſame Apoſtle ſays <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. That this holy hope is to Chriſtians, that which the anchor is to a Ship, which keeps it ſecure and ſteady amidſt the tempeſtuous waves, and preſerves it againſt the violence of the winds.</p>
                     <p>O holy Virtue, what bleſſings by thy means accrue unto us, did we but fall into the account and know them! Endeavour, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to make thy ſelf maſter in an happy hour of this great vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to practiſe it with advantage to thy Soul;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:38446:189"/>and to this effect peruſe carefully and with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this little we ſhall ſay upon this Subject.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICLE V.</hi> That the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt is of great uſe to fortify and augment Hope, the Virtue in us.</head>
                     <p>GOD endowed us with this Virtue, when firſt he juſtified us in Baptiſm, where we received Sanctifying Grace, with the gifts of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and other Chriſtian Virtues.</p>
                     <p>It is encreaſed, I confeſs, together with the other Virtues, by the frequent acts which we elicite, and by good works, which we perform in the State of Grace: but it is alſo certain, that it receives much ſtrength and wonderfull growth by the moſt Bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt; which may eaſily be evinced from the two things, which as is above ſaid are the object of Hope, <hi>viz.</hi> Grace in this Life, and in the next the Glory, as well of Body as of Soul.</p>
                     <p>As for Glory, there is not any thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms us more in the Hope of it then this Divine Sacrament, wherein we receive the very Perſon himſelf, the poſſeſſion of whom compleats all our glory and our happineſs; for what greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can we have, that we ſhall one day enjoy God himſelf, then by this bounty he hath ſhewed in communicating himſelf unto us in this life? Could he afford us a more ſecure pledge then he himſelf is? to which he hath alſo vouchſafed to
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:38446:190"/>add the aſſurance of his word, ſaying <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.58. that <hi>he who eateth this bread ſhall live for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for the glory of the body, it is no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto us by this Sacrament: being the Son of God hath told us, <hi>Ibid</hi> 56. that <hi>he who eateth his body, and drinketh his blood, ſhall have life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and that he will raiſe him again at the laſt day.</hi> And in effect the Fathers of the Church have often proved the Reſurrection from the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt: and they have held that the life-giving fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, as they have frequently call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, hath a particular vertue to raiſe from death to life thoſe bodies it ſhall touch, and conſerve them to immortality, much more efficaciouſly then the bones of <hi>Elizeus</hi> had vertue by their touch to raiſe a dead man to life.</p>
                     <p>This truth is no leſs certain in reſpect of grace. For if we conſider habituall or Sanctifying grace, this divine Sacrament is a powerfull means to conſerve it; as alſo to increaſe it in the Soul in an high degree, as often as we ſhall worthyly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And as for actuall graces, which are, as we ſaid, ſo many helps, illuminations, good and pious motions, which the divine goodneſs hath beſtowed upon us for the conſervation of his grace, and with which he inſpires us, that we may avoid evil and employ our ſelves totally in good; ſo many protections, which he affords us in the time, when our Salvation is in danger: it is queſtionleſs to this Sacrament that we owe the greateſt part thereof; as we clearly made out, <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Art.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon is evident; becauſe this Sacrament containing, as it really and truly doth, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the Author and ſource of all Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:38446:190"/>it cannot be but that it muſt needs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them in abundance to thoſe, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily receive it. If by the other Sacraments we are enrich'd with ſo many Graces by the only vertue which the Son of God hath granted to them; how many more may we in reaſon expect from this, where the ſame Son of God is preſent not only by ſome communication of his vertue, but by himſelf in Perſon?</p>
                     <p>God once gave <hi>Manna</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and he ſuſtained them therewith for the full ſpace of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, the time which their Pilgrimage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the land of Promiſe endur'd in the Deſert. This <hi>Manna</hi> fell every day early in the Morning together, as the Scripture remarks, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.9. with the Dew from Heaven, which bedewed the whole Camp of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And with how much more reaſon may we affirm, that none ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Celeſtial <hi>Manna,</hi> the Holy Euchariſt, (of which that is only a Type or Figure) in the happy morning before the World hath ſeized his thoughts, but he ſinds his Soul repleniſhed with abundance of Graces, and Divine Bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>For certainly if this Heavenly bread is ſhowred upon us for the nouriſhment of our needy and hungry Souls; without queſtion it works the ſame in her, which wholſome food doth in a ſound or healthy Body. Now Corporal nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath theſe four effects: It conſerves; it increaſes; it ſtrengthens; and it repairs the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It is neceſſary therefore that this Spiritual food have the ſame Operations in our Souls, if well diſpoſed; as we have already made out in the Firſt part of this Treatiſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Art.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>It was a Simbole of this truth, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

                        <hi>Elias,</hi> 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19. flying the Perſecution of <hi>Achab</hi> received from the hand of an Angel a Loaf of Bread, which maintained him through his whole Journey; and the Scripture affirms <hi>v.</hi> 8. that having eaten that bread, he received ſuch ſtrength, that without any further ſuſtenance he travelled full forty days, even to the Mountain <hi>Horeb,</hi> which is interpreted the ſight of God.</p>

                     <p>FRom the precedent we inferr this truth: For if the Bleſſed Sacrament augment in us the Virtue of Hope, it follows of neceſſity that to Communicate well we muſt beforehand exerciſe the acts of, and have our hearts repleniſhed with, the Virtue of Hope: as in the ſame manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe heat is natural to Fire, and Fire diſpenſeth not its effects but to the Subject which is already hot, it is neceſſary that the ſame heat ſhould be introduced into that matter, where one would have the Fire to act: for it is moſt certain, that the natural qualities of any thing whatſoever, ſerve as diſpoſitions to give both its being and its action. Since therefore the Holy Euchariſt is a Sacrament, which ſo powerfully revives our Hope, as we have already proved, it follows of neceſſity that to receive this Sacrament with that advantage it is capable to afford, it is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required that we be full of this Virtue, and ſtirr up our ſelves the moſt we can unto it, when
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:38446:191"/>we approach to this Holy Table.</p>
                     <p>And truly if we conſider the particular acts of which this Virtue ſeems, as it were, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, we ſhall find, that they are thoſe, which make up the moſt uſual diſpoſitions to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: we have mark'd them out above in the Third Article: An expectation of Eternal Life; a deſire to obtain it; a fear to looſe it by any Sin; a reſolution effectually to labour for it.

                     <p>THis is the third diſpoſition to a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and no leſs neceſſary then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two: yea, without it thoſe two great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues would not at all conduce, or diſpoſe the ſoul better for the worthy receiving of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        <pb n="362" facs="tcp:38446:195"/>Altho' your Faith were as great as that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and your hope equalled that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; if you have not Charity, you are not in a condition fit to entertain him, who is Charity himſelf, and who cannot dwell with him, who is without it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Altho' I ſhould have ſo ſtrong a Faith,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. <hi>ſo that I could move Mountains, without Charity it avails nothing,</hi> and proceeding he affirms, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Altho' I ſhould diſtribute all my goods amongſt the poor, and deliver my body to be burnt</hi> as the Martyrs have done, <hi>if I am void of Charity,</hi> all theſe great acts of Faith and Hope <hi>are of no uſe.</hi> If then theſe two Virtues without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are uſeleſs in reſpect of Salvation; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that of themſelves without Charity they are not ſufficient diſpoſitions to receive into our breſt the author of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>The Son of God entring into us by the Holy Communion, would willingly find there a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place prepared and worthy of him; which cannot be except Charity be there. For as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> ſays excellently well. <hi>Faith is the foundation of the houſe of God in</hi> our Soul, <hi>by Hope the Walls are raiſed; but Charity is the roof and perfection of the work. Domus Dei credendo fundatur, sperando eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur, diligendo perficitur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the reaſon why <hi>Salomon,</hi> as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Holy Writ, building a Temple to God, was not ſatisfied to lay the ground-work upon a Mountain, and build it with ſtones of great value; but over and above he cauſed, 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6.20. that part of the Temple, where the Ark of the Teſtament was to be placed, <hi>to be covered and ſeeled with the pureſt Gold.</hi> The Holy
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:38446:195"/>Ghoſt teaching us by this figure, that the houſe of God ought to be adorned with the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Gold of Charity, without which it cannot be an agreeable or pleaſing habitation for him.</p>
                     <p>In this divine Sacrament we receive the Bread of Life, whereby, as by Celeſtial food, our Soul is nouriſhed, and preſerv'd in the Life of Grace: It is then required that it find the Soul alive, no dead thing, being capable of nouriſhment. Now the life of the Soul is Charity, and (as the beloved Diſciple ſaith, 1. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.14.) <hi>He that loveth not is already dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Celeſtial bread is the bread of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; it is made for them, and it is an horrible Sacrilege for any one to receive it, who is not of that Number; as we have ſaid above, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Art.</hi> 5. <hi>Vere panis filiorum non mittendus canibus.</hi> Now what is it that makes men the Children of God? and what is it by which they are diſtinguiſhed from Children of the Devil? St. <hi>Auguſtin, Tract.</hi> 5. <hi>in Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Jo.</hi> ſaith, that it is Charity and nothing elſe. <hi>Dilectio ſola diſcernit inter filios Dei &amp; filios Diaboli.</hi> The ſign of the Croſs, Baptiſm, frequenting the Church, and the other marks of Chriſtianity do not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſtinguiſh betwixt the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Charity alone is the only diſtinctive ſign betwixt them. He who loves God is the Child of God: he who loves him not is the Child of perdition or of the Devil.</p>
                     <p>In fine, it is a Heavenly banquet, where our Lord gives himſelf for our food, his body for meat, and his blood for drink, and to which he invites us with a love, great beyond all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; but he invites only his friends. <hi>Eat,</hi> ſays
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:38446:196"/>he, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>my friends and drink.</hi> Now he is not a friend of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who doth not love him, who doth not comply with his will in all things. <hi>If you love me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.14. <hi>keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> v. 21. <hi>He who knows my Commandments and obſerves them, he,</hi> and he alone, <hi>it is that loves me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is his will that every one ſhould come to this Banquet with that preparation, which ſuch a feaſt deſerves: that we bring with us the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial garment: if he find here any one ſo raſh and temerarious, as to preſent himſelf before him, without this Ornament, he rejects him as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. Now this robe is nothing elſe, but that of Charity, which renders our Soul acceptable to God, and worthy to approach unto him. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 44.14. <hi>In veſtitu deaurato circundata varietate.</hi> In a word it is moſt certain, that to communicate well and as we ought, we muſt be in the ſtate of grace, which without Charity it is impoſſible to be; and this is the reaſon why we cannot communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate worthily without the Queen of Virtues.</p>

                     <p>THere is not any one, who queſtions the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent truth, all agreeing, that to receive worthily, there muſt of neceſſity be the love of God in our heart, ſince he hath beſtowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon us with ſuch an admirable, ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible a love.</p>
                     <p>But all do not agree in the nature and quality
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:38446:196"/>of this love, foraſmuch as there are many who judge of it rather according to their own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, then conſequent to the rules of truth.</p>
                     <p>There is not any one except perhaps ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious &amp; deſperate Perſon, who will not love God, whom he knows to be the Author of all good; and who does not at leaſt think he loves him; but there are almoſt infinite numbers of People, who deceive themſelves in this their belief, and have nothing but a falſe and imaginary hope of God, whereas they think, they truly love him.</p>
                     <p>Such is their Charity, who ſay they love God, and yet hate their Neighbour: or who will not pardon an injury, or deny to be reconciled to their Enemy; for as St. <hi>John</hi> ſays very well, 1. <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.20. <hi>If any one ſhall ſay he loves God and hates his brother, he is a Lyar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such is their Charity who ſay they love God, yet they have ill gotten goods, which they will not reſtore; who continue in an evil habit of Mortal Sin, without having a firm purpoſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; and theirs, who neglect to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the obligations of their State: In a word, all theirs, who fail in the obſervance of Gods Commandments in any thing whatſoever: This being an undoubted Maxim, that the true and only mark of the love of God is to keep his Commandments. <hi>If any one love me,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.23. <hi>he will keep my words,</hi> that is, my Commandments; <hi>he who doth not love me obſerves them not.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> after him, 1. <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.4. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that he who ſays, that <hi>he knoweth him</hi> God, that is in the Scripture phraſe, he who ſaith he loves God, <hi>and does not</hi> keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is a Lyar, and the truth is not in him.</p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:38446:197"/>
                     <p>All and every one of theſe ſorts of Charity are falſe and deceitfull; thoſe who love God in this manner, do not love him at all; and thoſe who Communicate only with this kind of love, are unworthy Communicants, and eat and drink Damnation to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The true love of God is only that, which makes us obſerve his Commandments in all things, which makes us fearfull to incurr his diſpleaſure by any Mortal Sin; and which makes us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr his friendſhip before all whatſoever is moſt dear unto us; as before our Pleaſures, our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, our Honour, and our Life it ſelf; being ready to looſe all or any of theſe things, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we might preſerve them, rather then offend God.</p>
                     <p>Behold, <hi>Theotime,</hi> what it is, that is the love of God, without which it is impoſsible to be in the State of Grace, or Communicate worthily and as we ought; and that you may underſtand it better, read what follows.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>ARTICLE III.</hi> What is Charity?</head>
                     <p>IT is a Virtue infuſed or given by God, which makes us love him above all things, and our Neighbour as our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>This definition is taken from the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God hath given us to love him, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt love,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, with thy whole Soul, with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind, and thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:38446:197"/>as thy ſelf.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>with thy whole heart,</hi> ſignify what we have already ſaid, that we muſt love God above all things, and that our heart ought to be wholly his; loving nothing either equal with him, or more then him, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and leſs then him, and only in order to his Service.</p>
                     <p>This greater love doth not conſiſt in having a more ardent, a more tender, and a more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective love for God then for any other thing, altho' this were to be wiſhed for: But it lies in this, that we eſteem God more then all the things of this world, and that in our heart and effectually we preferr his friendſhip before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods, and whatſoever it is, we love: So that we reſolve to abandon and looſe them all, rather then be deprived of the grace of God.</p>
                     <p>This preference and this reſolution are ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required in the love of God, that they are the only diſtinctive ſigns it hath, and it cannot ſubſiſt without them: So that in the moment in which any one willingly and in effect breaketh this reſolution, he looſeth the love of God. However, to make this preference and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we need not repreſent in particular all the things before which we ought to preferr the love of God: This is neither neceſſary nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expedient. It ſufficeth that we have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but an effectual reſolution, never to looſe the grace of God for any thing of the world, nor to do any thing whereby we may mortally of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him.</p>
                     <p>This reſolution is the fruit and off-ſpring of the Virtue of Charity, which is that Divine qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which God <hi>powers into our Souls,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:38446:198"/>us into his grace, <hi>by the holy Spirit which is given us,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues with us as long as we conſerve this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; but as ſoon as we come to looſe it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny either action or deſire, which is contrary unto it, we are immediately deprived of this holy Charity, which is the Queen and Mother of the other Virtues, and without which all others are inſignificant in order to Salvation.</p>
                     <p>I do not here examine the motives, which ought to induce us to the love of God; <hi>viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that of the reward we expect from him, or that of friendſhip and benevolence which we owe him: Charity eaſily unites theſe two together; &amp; although it be not built or grounded upon the reward, yet it doth not exclude it: but the Soul which is endowed with Charity, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God for himſelf, expects at his hands the reward of that love, which is him himſelf. She loves God becauſe of the recompence; but ſhe takes care that ſhe do not ſay, that ſhe loves him by reaſon of the reward alone: for ſhe would love him, although ſhe looked for nothing from him; and (as St. <hi>Bernard de diligendo Deo</hi> ſays excellently well) <hi>We never love God without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; altho' we ought to love him without minding the reward: for tho' true Charity be never fruitleſs, yet it is not mercenary; ſhe ſeeks not her own Intereſt. It is an affection of the Soul, not a contract. It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſelf obtain'd, nor doth it get any thing by bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> as Merchants do. <hi>It is a voluntary affection and makes one give himſelf freely</hi> to his God. <hi>True love is ſatisfied with it ſelf, its reward is our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have already ſpoken of this Virtue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:38446:198"/>and in it ſelf in other places, as in the <hi>Inſtruction of Youth, Part.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. and in that of Penance, in the Examen upon the Firſt Commandment: Wherefore I ſhall only add here, what concerns it in relation to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt, and in as much as it ſerves for the Holy Communion.</p>

                        <hi>ARTICLE IV.</hi> Of the Motives of the love of God.</head>
                     <p>IT was an admirable expreſſion of St. <hi>Bernard, ibid.</hi> that the reaſon of loving God is God himſelf; and therefore when any one asks, why we ought to love God? One cannot anſwer bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then by ſaying, becauſe he is God.</p>
                     <p>But being God contains in himſelf an infinity of perfections and qualities, which render him infinitely amiable; this general reaſon of loving God, becauſe he is God, is divided into many particular Motives, which are ſo many ſeveral obligations to love that infinite goodneſs, which can never be ſufficiently loved.</p>
                     <p>Thus when I conſider, that God is great and perfect in himſelf, an that he circles within himſelf all poſſible perfections, all Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Wiſdom, Juſtice, I find reaſon to love him above all other things; becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amongſt Creatures, which is ſo amiable as he; and he deſerves to be beloved, altho', ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a thing impoſſible, he ſhould never have done us any good.</p>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:38446:199"/>
                     <p>If I deſcend to the benefits, which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us, and conſider him as Creator of Heaven and Earth, and of all thoſe excellent pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he hath made for our ſake, I find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to love him above all things: for how can I but love ſo great a bounty, which hath wrought ſuch wonders for us? <hi>Heaven and Earth, and all things in them,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin, l.</hi> 10. <hi>Conf. c.</hi> 6. <hi>tell me on every ſide to love thee: they declare the ſame to all, that none may be excus'd, if they do not love thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If I reflect upon my ſelf, I acknowledge I am the work of that immenſe goodneſs, which out of nothing hath made me what I am; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refrain from loving him, if I love my ſelf, and own my ſelf for what I am, <hi>viz.</hi> the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God. This made St. <hi>Bernard, ibid.</hi> ſay, <hi>that God deſerves to be loved for his own ſake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the very Infidel; who although he be ignorant of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>yet he knows himſelf; therefore even the Infidel is inexcuſable, if he do not love his Lord with all his heart, with all his Soul, with all his ſtrength:</hi> viz. <hi>A certain innate or natural equity, not unknown to Reaſon cries out aloud to him from within, that he ought to love him with all his power, from whom he cannot but know, that he hath received all whatſoe're he hath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If I conſider the Redemption, I there find a bottomleſs Abyſs of love, an unexhauſtible fountain, from whence motives to love that great and ſingular goodneſs, which hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me from an eternal ruine, continually flow. For, as St. <hi>Bernard, ibid.</hi> very well obſerves, <hi>If I owe my ſelf totally to God for that I am Created by him, how much more do I owe him, for that he hath
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:38446:199"/>Redeemed me, and in ſuch a manner: For I was not ſo eaſily Redeemed, as I was at firſt Created. At my Creation it was ſaid of me, as well as of all other things. He ſaid</hi> the word, <hi>and they were made.</hi> To Create me coſt him but one word: <hi>But he who made me by ſpeaking, and that only once, when he redeemed me, ſpoke much, he wrought wonders, and ſuffer'd much hardſhip and many indignities. In the firſt work he gave me my ſelf,</hi> or what I am; <hi>in the ſecond he gave himſelf, and giving himſelf for me, he reſtored me to my ſelf. What return ſhall</hi> or can <hi>I make to God for himſelf?</hi> I owe my ſelf entirely to him in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment for my Creation, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for me to give for my Redemption? <hi>and although I could repay my ſelf a thouſand times, what am I in compariſon to my Lord?</hi>

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:38446:200"/>exception to this generall rule: the divine love knows no bounds; it paſſeth beyond the bounds of death; and as it is ingenious, inventive, and omnipotent, it finds out innumerable ways to make its grandure and its exceſs appear.</p>
                     <p>The Charity of Jeſus Chriſt was not content to lay down his life for us men and our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to reconcile us to God by his death, even then when we were his enemies, according to the remark of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.10. or as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in the place above-cited notes, to love us firſt, <hi>tantus &amp; tantum &amp; gratis, tantillos &amp; tales, He being ſo great, to love ſo much, &amp; gratis, ſuch, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Perſons;</hi> That is, with ſuch an exceſs of love, and ſuch an abaſement of his greatneſs to love to an extremity even ſuch pitifull &amp; wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creatures, repleniſhed with Sins, &amp; all ſorts of miſeries, and all this <hi>gratis,</hi> that is without any intereſt of his ſide, but meerly upon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our good.</p>
                     <p>This divine love hath found out means how he may always be with us, and never depart from thoſe, whom he hath loved ſo far as to dy for them; he hath found out an invention to remain with us, and yet be abſent from us: and having withdrawn from us his viſible preſence, he hath nevertheleſs found out a way how ſtill we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him. He hath given us his fleſh for meat, and his blood for drink; he hath ſhut them up under the figure of Bread &amp; Wine, that we might more commodiouſly receive them: and by means of this divine invention he enters into and takes poſſeſſion of us, he Sanctifies our Soul and Body; he enlivens us with his grace; he cures our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour maladies; he ſtrengthens our weakneſs; in

                     <p>O Skillfull and ingenious love! O admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, proper to God alone! Here we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm with truth, what the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> ſaid, <hi>ch.</hi> 45.15. <hi>vere tu es Deus abſconditus Deus Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Sacrament of the Euchariſt God is truly hidden, becauſe he hath herein invented a way to conceal the grandure of his Majeſty, that ſo we might more eaſily approach unto him. and it is in this holy Sacrament that we may ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſ.</hi> 30.20. <hi>O my God! how great without number are the effects of thy goodneſs, which thou reſerveſt for the benefit of thoſe, who hear thee, and haſt made them appear in the ſight of the whole world towards all thoſe, who place their hopes in thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What return can we make to God for ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and ſo incomprehenſible a good? For if we do not know how ſufficiently to acknowledg the benefit of our creation, much leſs are we able to make any retutn for that of our redemption; how then can we teſtify our gratitude for this third effect, and the utmoſt exceſs of the divine goodneſs, wherein he not only gives himſelf for us, but beſtows himſelf upon us; that we may truly enjoy &amp; take poſſeſſion of him? <hi>Quid Deo retribuam pro ſe? nam etſi millies me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dero, quid ſum ego ad Dominum meum?

And as thou hadſt grace after thou hadſt happily born him in thy womb, to conſerve him alſo more fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thy heart; obtain of him for me the like favour, without which this Communion would not be uſefull to me: O Holy mother of God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me, that I may conceive in my Soul thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, that he may be born in me, that he may dayly increaſe, that he may there live and

                        <hi>ARTICLE IX.</hi> How we ought to ſpend the day of our Communion.</head>
                     <p>IT is an advice of very great conſequence to ſpend all that day in Piety and Devotion, wherein you have performed ſo holy, ſo religious and ſo auguſt an action; and to honour that day by the exerciſe of good works, upon which God hath been pleas'd to Sanctify you by his preſence.</p>
                     <p>To ſpend it otherwiſe is to fail in your reſpect to Jeſus Chriſt, and it happens but too often, that by this neglect of our duty we looſe the greater part of the fruit, which otherwiſe we might reap from the holy Table of Communion.</p>
                     <p>What then you are to do, <hi>Theotime,</hi> on that day, is frequently in the day time to call to mind, and ſeriouſly to reflect upon the honour you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and to acknowledg that it is beyond your capacity ſufficiently to eſteem it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, Not to diſtract your mind either with vain divertiſements, or with unprofitable &amp; frivolous diſcourſes: but to be more ſerious, modeſt and reſerved, in all the actions of that day, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring what honour it is, &amp; how they value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are admitted to the preſence of a
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:38446:207"/>King, and conſequently what hath been done to you, whileſt you were choſen to be the Temple of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly. Employ all that day in good works, as far as you are able: as the reſt of the morning in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, or reading ſome good book. After dinner in hearing the word of God, aſsiſting at Evenſong; and the remainder of the day either in diſcourſe with good and virtuous perſons, or in reading.</p>
                     <p>At night in your prayers be not unmindfull to give God thanks for your Communion, and for all the favours, which he hath beſtowed upon you. Beſeech him moſt earneſtly that he will give you grace to benefit your ſelf there-by the next day, and all the remainder of your life, and to practiſe well all the reſolutions you have made upon this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>But for the better complyance with theſe holy reſolutions, remember that you renew them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in your morning prayers, even to the day of your following Communion; and at night in your examen of conſcience ſee and conſider well whether you have faithfully fullfill'd them, or whether you have failed therein, and broke your promiſe, and in what? that ſo you may rectify your ſelf out of hand, and ſet your ſelf again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right way of the Service of God, and the path of your own Salvation.</p>

                     <p>NOthing remains, but that I exhort you to Communicate often, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> and benefit your ſelf of the great advantages, which God preſents you with in this Divine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>It is in reality a great benefit to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated well in the manner we have but juſt now declared; But if after this, one abſtain a long time from it, he endangers himſelf to looſe the fruit of the foregoing Communion by relapſing into Sin and the diſorders of his former Life.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain proportion betwixt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Corporal nouriſhment. This requires we ſhould take it, as often as the neceſſity of our Body ſhall require: and we need it according as the natural heat conſumes our ſubſtance, and whatſoever elſe ſerves for its ſubſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>The ſame we muſt affirm of Spiritual food, which ſerves to repair the forces of the Soul, which are continually diminiſhed and weakened by Concupiſcence, and all the paſſions with which it is aſſaulted. If theſe forces are not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently recruited, the Life of Grace is by degrees much weakned, and totally loſt at length. Now that which ſerves to repair them is the Sacred Euchariſt, which renews our ſtrength and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores our Soul to her former vigour, weakening
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:38446:208"/>Concupiſcence, diminiſhing the Paſsions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving her from Mortal, nay even from Venial Sins, as we have already ſaid and proved at large.</p>
                     <p>After this is there any neceſsity of other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to perſuade either you, or any other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to frequent Communion? Certainly thoſe, who are willing to do what is pleaſing in the ſight of God, and to continue in his grace, have need of none.</p>
                     <p>And, I ſuppoſe, you are one of that number: I exhort you then by the Charity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and by the exceſs of love, which he ſhewed us, in beſtowing himſelf upon us in this adorable Myſtery, as the beſt means for our Salvation, that you will frequently approach unto him in this Divine Sacrament; to the end he may remain in you and you in him, according as he himſelf hath promiſed, and you ſurely cannot but deſire.</p>
                     <p>Conſider that your Soul is always ſick, and that theſe Diſtempers, if neglected, may bring you to Eternal Death. Come then to this great Phyſitian, who only is able to cure you, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you from death, by this Bread, which he hath given, as himſelf affirms, for the Life of the World. <hi>Joan.</hi> 6.52. <hi>Panis quem ego dabo caro mea eſt pro mundi vita.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ponder, O ponder well upon the earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he hath to relieve you, in all your wants, and the ardent love with which he calls and even compels you to come unto him, <hi>Mat</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come to me all you that labour, and are burthened and I will refreſh you:— In me you ſhall find the repoſe which your Souls deſire.</hi> They who are not won with theſe ſo moving and vehement expreſsions, do they not evidently ſhew, that they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:38446:209"/>inſenſible of the love, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath ſo plainly teſtified he hath for them, and that they are enemies to their own Salvation? Is it poſsible that you ſhould be one of theſe? Look to it, for if you be, you are not of the number of the Children of God: for Children liſten and attend to the voice of their Father; come to him willingly, and eſteem themſelves happy in his company; and above all they take it for a peculiar honour, that they are admitted to eat at his Table.</p>
                     <p>What ſhame is it then for Chriſtians ſo to neglect ſo great a treaſure, and ſo nigh at hand; to be juſt at the Spring-head of Divine Graces, and not eſteem them; to remain in the death of Sin, when the Fountain of Life is at their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.11. <hi>quare moriemini domus Iſrael? and why do you deliver your ſelves to death, O houſe of</hi> Iſrael? O Chriſtians amongſt whom God hath choſe his habitation upon earth, why do you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your ſelves thus to dye, having the author of Life ſo near you; who invites you to come, and threatens you, if you do not accept his invitation. Crying out to you in a loud voice, <hi>John</hi> 6.54. <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ye eat my Body and drink my Blood, you ſhall have no life in you.</hi> Adding that <hi>he who eateth me ſhall live for my ſake.</hi> After ſuch threats, if we do not come, and ſo great aſſurance if we do; what can we alledge before the divine Tribunall at the day of judgment, if ſtill we are at a diſtance from him, from God the Fountain of life, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill companions to the enemy of mankind in the ſtate of death and Sin? and this becauſe we are unwilling ſo to live, that frequently we may partake of this living and life-giving bread.</p>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:38446:209"/>
                     <p>Call to mind the feaſt in the parable, <hi>Luc.</hi> 14. where the Maſter of the houſe ſhewed ſo much anger and indignation againſt thoſe who refuſed to come, after they had been ſo ſolemnly invited. They excuſed themſelves the beſt they could, ſome with their affairs, others with their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; one ſaid he was obliged to go to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try houſe, another that he went to try the Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en he had bought; and the third that he was taken up and employed about his marriage: but not any of theſe excuſes were admitted, they were all rejected as frivolous pleas, and therefore themſelves for framing them were all judged worthy to be, not only then but ever after, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from that Banquet.</p>
                     <p>And this is the method which God ſhall uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſtians, who refrain from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon the vain pretences, which uſually they form to themſelves; for all their excuſes ſhall be rejected and themſelves puniſhed, as in in the Parable we have ſeen.</p>
                     <p>To thoſe who ſhall excuſe themſelves with the affairs and employments of the world, it ſhall be anſwer'd, that there is no concern of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as that of their Salvation; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to prefer before all other things. And they ſhall be reproached with this, that they have prefer'd their temporal concerns before their eternal happineſs: and made more account of the poſſeſſions of this world, then of the grace of God.</p>
                     <p>To thoſe, who ſhall excuſe themſelves, with the indiſpoſitions of their Soul, ſaying, that they have not that virtue which is required for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Communion. One may reply, that their excuſe is but too true, yet it is a very bad one;
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:38446:210"/>for that it is their duty ſo to live, that they may Communicate dayly, and to uſe all imaginable induſtry to render themſelves capable thereof.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we ſhall find that there is no other cauſe why people communicate but ſeldom, beſides their ſloath, their indevotion, and fear, leſt, if they ſhould frequent the Sacraments, thereby they ſhou'd be obliged to live holily; and in a word, a will, or a tacit reſolution not to amend their lives, but to remain in their Sins, their Pleaſures, their Covetuouſneſs, Ambition, and in all their irregular affections.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Theotime,</hi> avoid this great misfortune; this fault ſo generall, and yet ſo common amongſt Chriſtians, who ſlight in this manner their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the great advantages which by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; Mercy of God are preſented to them. Learn in time to ſet a great value on them, &amp; to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage your ſelf from thence, approaching frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to theſe divine myſteries inſtituted by God, the means for your Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Begin this exerciſe from your youth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it thence-forward all your life, that you may perform it dayly better and better, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener approach to the Holy Table of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and receive our Lord.</p>

                     <p>THe time, which you ought moſt commonly to obſerve in your communion, is that of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very month; ſo that you ſhould not exceed that time without giving your Soul the opportunity to partake of this divine nouriſhment of the holy Euchariſt.</p>
                     <p>It is very hard for you to ſtay ſo long without having a conſiderable want of help to reſiſt the temptations of your Ghoſtly enemy; or repreſs the paſſions which ſpring from your age and the heat of blood. You have need of ſtrength, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may be able to withſtand the Devil, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of a good preſervative againſt your ſelf: The one and the other you ſhall find in the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, wherefore it is fit you have recourſe unto it according to the proportion of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity you find that you have thereof.</p>

                     <p>The 2d is, when you perceive in your ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable want thereof, as when you are aſſaulted with more violent, or more frequent temptations, for then you muſt have recourſe to this remedy to ſtrengthen you, leaſt you fall into mortall Sin.</p>

                        <head>An Advice of great Conſequence.</head>
                        <p>BUt I adviſe you at all times, and eſpecially in this, wherein actually you now are, carefully to avoid three faults, which are incident eaſily to them, who Communicate upon ſet days.</p>
                        <p>The 1ſt is, that they communicate by cuſtome, and by courſe, without propoſing to themſelves an end or deſign in their communion.</p>
                        <p>The 2d is, that they Communicate with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no preparation, and without devotion.</p>
                        <p>The 3d is, that they reap no fruit or very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, perſiſting ſtill in the ſame vitious habits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable veniall, and many times mortall Sins.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are three faults which prejudice fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Communion in an high degree, and which makes one loſe the greateſt part of the fruit thereof, and renders it oftentimes rather worſe, then better for us.</p>
                        <p>Let it be your chief care to avoid them, and to this end remember every time you come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, to comply with theſe three duties di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the former faults.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, to propoſe to your ſelf always a good end; which you hope to compaſs by means of your Communion; ſuch as is above-mentioned,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:38446:212"/>
                           <hi>viz.</hi> to pleaſe God, to advance in his grace, and to ſtrengthen or to ground your ſelf better in virtue.</p>
                        <p n="2">2ly. Prepare your ſelf always the beſt you can, and endeavour to ſtir your ſelf up to ſome act of great devotion: and to this effect take care that you put in practiſe the directions we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given upon this Subject.</p>
                        <p n="3">3ly. Endeavour to amend your evil habits, and to make good uſe of all the graces which you have received by means of this Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is a matter of high concern, and of which you ought to have a ſpeciall care.</p>
                        <p>Remember that there are two faults which you ought equally to eſchew in the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The one is to Communicate too ſeldom: the other is to Communicate often, but to no effect. By the Firſt, one neglects and looſes the graces of God; by the Second, one abuſes thoſe, which one has received: both which leade di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to damnation.</p>
                        <p>Fly theſe two rocks, upon either of which your Salvation may eaſily ſuffer ſhipwrack. Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate often with the diſpoſition above-mention'd; and advantage your ſelf of the Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in order to the amendment of your life, your advancement in virtue, and the love of God. If you do thus, <hi>Theotime,</hi> the bleſſing of God will fall upon your devotion; and he will dayly ſhower new graces upon your Soul, that you may better ſerve him all the remainder of your days in this, and enjoy him perfectly in the next life for evermore. Amen.</p>
